	abstract = {Single-molecule, real-time sequencing developed by Pacific BioSciences offers longer read lengths than the second-generation sequencing (SGS) technologies, making it well-suited for unsolved problems in genome, transcriptome, and epigenetics research. The highly-contiguous de novo assemblies using PacBio sequencing can close gaps in current reference assemblies and characterize structural variation (SV) in personal genomes. With longer reads, we can sequence through extended repetitive regions and detect mutations, many of which are associated with diseases. Moreover, PacBio transcriptome sequencing is advantageous for the identification of gene isoforms and facilitates reliable discoveries of novel genes and novel isoforms of annotated genes, due to its ability to sequence full-length transcripts or fragments with significant lengths. Additionally, PacBio’s sequencing technique provides information that is useful for the direct detection of base modifications, such as methylation. In addition to using PacBio sequencing alone, many hybrid sequencing strategies have been developed to make use of more accurate short reads in conjunction with PacBio long reads. In general, hybrid sequencing strategies are more affordable and scalable especially for small-size laboratories than using PacBio Sequencing alone. The advent of PacBio sequencing has made available much information that could not be obtained via SGS alone.},

              transcript can be exported and translated into proteins in the cytoplasm. While some sequences are always included or excluded (constitutive splicing), others can be selectively used (alternative splicing) in this process. Particularly by alternative splicing, up to tens of thousands of variant transcripts can be produced from a single gene, which contributes greatly to the proteomic diversity for such complex cellular functions as ‘wiring’ neurons in the nervous system. Disruption of this process leads to aberrant splicing, which accounts for the defects of up to 50\% of mutations that cause certain human genetic diseases. In this review, we describe the different mechanisms of aberrant splicing that cause or have been associated with neurological diseases.

	abstract = {Pre-messenger RNA splicing is initiated with the recognition of a single-nucleotide intronic branchpoint (BP) within a BP motif by spliceosome elements. Forty-eight rare variants in 43 human genes have been reported to alter splicing and cause disease by disrupting BP. However, until now, no computational approach was available to efficiently detect such variants in massively parallel sequencing data. We established a comprehensive human genome-wide BP database by integrating existing BP data and generating new BP data from RNA sequencing of lariat debranching enzyme DBR1-mutated patients and from machine-learning predictions. We characterized multiple features of BP in major and minor introns and found that BP and BP-2 (two nucleotides upstream of BP) positions exhibit a lower rate of variation in human populations and higher evolutionary conservation than the intronic background, while being comparable to the exonic background. We developed BPHunter as a genome-wide computational approach to systematically and efficiently detect intronic variants that may disrupt BP recognition. BPHunter retrospectively identified 40 of the 48 known pathogenic BP variants, in which we summarized a strategy for prioritizing BP variant candidates. The remaining eight variants all create AG-dinucleotides between the BP and acceptor site, which is the likely reason for missplicing. We demonstrated the practical utility of BPHunter prospectively by using it to identify a novel germline heterozygous BP variant of STAT2 in a patient with critical COVID-19 pneumonia and a novel somatic intronic 59-nucleotide deletion of ITPKB in a lymphoma patient, both of which were validated experimentally. BPHunter is publicly available from https://hgidsoft.rockefeller.edu/BPHunter and https://github.com/casanova-lab/BPHunter.},

	abstract = {The branchpoint (BP) motif is an essential intronic element for spliceosomal pre-mRNA splicing. In mammals, its sequence composition, distance to the downstream exon, and number of BPs per 3´ splice site are highly variable, unlike the GT/AG dinucleotides at the intron ends. These variations appear to provide evolutionary advantages for fostering alternative splicing, satisfying more diverse cellular contexts, and promoting resilience to genetic changes, thus contributing to an extra layer of complexity for gene regulation. Importantly, variants in the BP motif itself or in genes encoding BP-interacting factors cause human genetic diseases or cancers, highlighting the critical function of BP motif and the need to precisely identify functional BPs for faithful interpretation of their roles in splicing. In this perspective, we will succinctly summarize the major findings related to BP motif variations, discuss the relevant issues/challenges, and provide our insights.},

	abstract = {Although the Dictyocaulus lungworm, the agent of dictyocaulosis, is one of parasitological threats to European bison, its systematic position remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the morphological features of the lungworm and the pathological lesions it induces, and to analyse mitochondrial (mt) genetic markers for systematic and molecular epidemiological studies. The morphological findings indicate that Dictyocaulus lungworms of European bison can be distinguished from those of cattle on the basis of differences in buccal capsule wall length, total body length, and spicules length in males, all of which were significantly longer in those of European bison. Nucleotide diversity calculated from pairwise sequence alignments of partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1), cytochrome B (cytB) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (nad5) of specimens from cattle and European bison varied from 1.7\% for nad5, 2.1\% for cytB, to 3.7\% for cox1 gene. Thus, among the lungworms of European bison and cattle, nad5 and cytB were the most conserved proteins, whereas cox1 was the most diverse. The mt cytB marker gene may be a suitable candidate for distinguishing between the two genotypes, as nad5 demonstrated the greatest within-genus sequence variation. The lung tissue of infected European bison manifests signs of verminous pneumonia characterized by interstitial pneumonia, bronchitis and bronchiolitis. Therefore, it appears that European bison and cattle are infected with slightly diverged, morphologically-different, genotypes of D. viviparus, indicating they belong to two separate worm populations. We propose, therefore, that the lungworm of European bison should be classified as D. viviparus subsp. bisontis.,

	abstract = {Many parasitic nematodes actively seek out hosts in which to complete their lifecycles [1]. Olfaction is thought to play an important role in the host-seeking process, with parasites following a chemical trail toward host-associated odors [2–7]. However, little is known about the olfactory cues that attract parasitic nematodes to hosts or the behavioral responses these cues elicit. Moreover, what little is known focuses on easily obtainable laboratory hosts rather than natural or other ecologically relevant hosts. Here we investigate the olfactory responses of six diverse species of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) to seven ecologically relevant potential invertebrate hosts, including one known natural host and other potential hosts collected from the environment. We show that EPNs respond differentially to the odor blends emitted by live potential hosts as well as individual host-derived odorants. In addition, we show that EPNs use the universal host cue carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as host-specific odorants for host location, but the relative importance of CO2 versus host-specific odorants varies for different parasite-host combinations and for different host-seeking behaviors. We also identify novel host-derived odorants by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and find that many of these odorants stimulate host-seeking behaviors in a species-specific manner. Taken together, our results demonstrate that parasitic nematodes have evolved specialized olfactory systems that likely contribute to appropriate host selection.},

This awareness now provides means of connecting ecological and evolutionary theory with diverse biological patterns within and among species in terms of adaptation, sexual selection, breeding systems, speciation, and other phenomena. Moreover, the heralded laboratory tractability of C. elegans, and Caenorhabditis species generally, provides a powerful case study for experimental hypothesis testing about evolutionary and ecological processes to levels of detail unparalleled by most study systems. Here, I synthesize pertinent theory with what we know and suspect about Caenorhabditis natural history for salient features of biodiversity, phenotypes, population dynamics, and interactions within and between species. I identify topics of pressing concern to advance Caenorhabditis biology and to study general evolutionary processes, including the key opportunities to tackle problems in dispersal dynamics, competition, and the dimensionality of niche space.},

	abstract = {Meiotic recombination is a fundamental cellular process, with important consequences for evolution and genome integrity. However, we know little about how recombination rates vary across the genomes of most species and the molecular and evolutionary determinants of this variation. The honeybee, Apis mellifera, has extremely high rates of meiotic recombination, although the evolutionary causes and consequences of this are unclear. Here we use patterns of linkage disequilibrium in whole genome resequencing data from 30 diploid honeybees to construct a fine-scale map of rates of crossing over in the genome. We find that, in contrast to vertebrate genomes, the recombination landscape is not strongly punctate. Crossover rates strongly correlate with levels of genetic variation, but not divergence, which indicates a pervasive impact of selection on the genome. Germ-line methylated genes have reduced crossover rate, which could indicate a role of methylation in suppressing recombination. Controlling for the effects of methylation, we do not infer a strong association between gene expression patterns and recombination. The site frequency spectrum is strongly skewed from neutral expectations in honeybees: rare variants are dominated by AT-biased mutations, whereas GC-biased mutations are found at higher frequencies, indicative of a major influence of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), which we infer to generate an allele fixation bias 5 – 50 times the genomic average estimated in humans. We uncover further evidence that this repair bias specifically affects transitions and favours fixation of CpG sites. Recombination, via gBGC, therefore appears to have profound consequences on genome evolution in honeybees and interferes with the process of natural selection. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the forces driving molecular evolution.},

Despite this conserved function, sperm competition and coevolution with female traits can drive spectacular morphological change in these cells. Here, we characterize four repeated instances of convergent evolution of sperm gigantism in Caenorhabditis nematodes using phylogenetic comparative methods on 26 species. Species at the extreme end of the 50-fold range of sperm-cell volumes across the genus have sperm capable of comprising up to 5\% of egg-cell volume, representing severe attenuation of the magnitude of anisogamy. Furthermore, we uncover significant differences in mean and variance of sperm size among genotypes, between sexes, and within and between individuals of identical genotypes. We demonstrate that the developmental basis of sperm size variation, both within and between species, becomes established during an early stage of sperm development at the formation of primary spermatocytes, while subsequent meiotic divisions contribute little further sperm size variability. These findings provide first insights into the developmental determinants of inter- and intraspecific sperm size differences in Caenorhabditis. We hypothesize that life history and ecological differences among species favored the evolution of alternative sperm competition strategies toward either many smaller sperm or fewer larger sperm.},

This logic describes the specialist-generalist variation hypothesis (SGVH). Some outbreeding species of Caenorhabditis nematodes use a variety of invertebrate dispersal vectors and have high molecular diversity. By contrast, Caenorhabditis japonica lives in a strict association and synchronized life cycle with its dispersal host, the shield bug Parastrachia japonensis, itself a diet specialist. Here, we characterize sequence variation for 20 nuclear loci to investigate how C. japonica's life history shapes nucleotide diversity. We find that C. japonica has more than threefold lower polymorphism than other outbreeding Caenorhabditis species, but that local populations are not genetically disconnected. Coupled with its restricted range, we propose that its specialist host association contributes to a smaller effective population size and lower genetic variation than host generalist Caenorhabditis species with outbreeding reproductive modes. A literature survey of diverse organisms provides broader support for the SGVH. These findings encourage further testing of ecological and evolutionary hypotheses with comparative population genetics in Caenorhabditis and other taxa.},

In particular, the separate estimation of the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions is a powerful tool for detecting selection of the latter. The difference in the patterns of these two types of substitutions of mammalian genes turned out to be in accord with the slightly deleterious or nearly neutral mutation theory for nonsynonymous changes. Interaction systems at the amino acid level were suggested to be responsible for such nearly neutral, or very weak, selection. Synonymous substitutions are not strictly neutral, but because of their minute effect, random drift predominates such that the rate of substitution is only slightly less than the completely neutral prediction. It was concluded that the strictly neutral theory has not held up as well as the nearly neutral theory, yet remains invaluable as a null hypothesis for detecting selection. On the other hand, the main difference between the nearly neutral and the traditional selection theories is that the former predicts rapid evolution in small populations, whereas the latter predicts rapid evolution in large populations.},

	abstract = {The regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability has a profound impact on gene expression dynamics during embryogenesis. For example, in animals, maternally deposited mRNAs are degraded after fertilization to enable new developmental trajectories. Regulatory sequences in 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) have long been considered the central determinants of mRNA stability. However, recent work indicates that the coding sequence also possesses regulatory information. Specifically, translation in cis impacts mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner. However, the strength of this mechanism during embryogenesis, as well as its relationship with other known regulatory elements, such as microRNA, remains unclear. Here, we show that codon composition is a major predictor of mRNA stability in the early embryo. We show that this mechanism works in combination with other cis-regulatory elements to dictate mRNA stability in zebrafish and Xenopus embryos as well as in mouse and human cells. Furthermore, we show that microRNA targeting efficacy can be affected by substantial enrichment of optimal (stabilizing) or non-optimal (destabilizing) codons. Lastly, we find that one microRNA, miR-430, antagonizes the stabilizing effect of optimal codons during early embryogenesis in zebrafish. By integrating the contributions of different regulatory mechanisms, our work provides a framework for understanding how combinatorial control of mRNA stability shapes the gene expression landscape.},

Thus codon usage in the highly expressed group shows a higher correlation with tRNA abundance, a greater degree of third base pyrimidine bias, and a lesser tendency to the A+T richness which is characteristic of the yeast genome. The cluster analysis can be used to predict the likely level of gene expression of any gene, and identifies the pattern of codon usage likely to yield optimal gene expression in yeast.},

This revealed the central role of GC content in mRNA fate, in terms of P-body localization, mRNA translation and mRNA stability: P-bodies contain mostly AU-rich mRNAs, which have a particular codon usage associated with a low protein yield; AU-rich and GC-rich transcripts tend to follow distinct decay pathways; and the targets of sequence-specific RBPs and miRNAs are also biased in terms of GC content.

However, previous studies disregarded differences in the genomic context of genes, which could potentially obscure any correlation between GC content and expression. In the present work, we directly compared the expression of GC-rich and GC-poor genes placed in the context of identical promoters and UTR sequences. We performed transient and stable transfections of mammalian cells with GC-rich and GC-poor versions of Hsp70, green fluorescent protein, and IL2 genes. The GC-rich genes were expressed several-fold to over a 100-fold more efficiently than their GC-poor counterparts. This effect was not due to different translation rates of GC-rich and GC-poor mRNA. On the contrary, the efficient expression of GC-rich genes resulted from their increased steady-state mRNA levels. mRNA degradation rates were not correlated with GC content, suggesting that efficient transcription or mRNA processing is responsible for the high expression of GC-rich genes. We conclude that silent-site GC content correlates with gene expression efficiency in mammalian cells.},

From analysis of human exons, we find that 47 of the 59 codons with at least one synonym show differential usage in the proximity of exon ends, of which 42 remain significant after correction for multiple testing. Within sets of synonymous codons those more preferred near splice sites are generally those that are relatively more abundant within the ESEs. However, the examples given previously appear exceptionally good fits and there exist many exceptions, the usage of lysine's codons being a case in point. Similar results are observed in mouse exons.

Strikingly, our analysis reveals a single dominant variable linked to the number of translation events which explains 40-fold more variation in evolutionary rate than any other, suggesting that protein evolutionary rate has a single major determinant among the seven predictors. The dominant variable explains nearly half the variation in the rate of synonymous and protein evolution. We show that the two most commonly used methods to disentangle the determinants of evolutionary rate, partial correlation analysis and ordinary multivariate regression, produce misleading or spurious results when applied to noisy biological data. We overcome these difficulties by employing principal component regression, a multivariate regression of evolutionary rate against the principal components of the predictor variables.

The approach is applied to 80 phylogenetically diverse bacterial species for which whole genome sequences are available. The strength of selected codon usage bias, S, is found to vary substantially among species; in 30\% of the genomes examined, there was no significant evidence that selection had been effective. Values of S are highly positively correlated with both the number of rRNA operons and the number of tRNA genes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that species exposed to selection for rapid growth have more rRNA operons, more tRNA genes and more strongly selected codon usage bias. For example, Clostridium perfringens, the species with the highest value of S, can have a generation time as short as 7 min.},

Conversely, codon usage is likely to exert selection pressure on tRNA abundance4. Here I develop a model for the coevolution of codon usage and tRNA abundance which explains why there are unequal abundances of synonymous tRNAs leading to biased usage between groups of codons recognized by them in unicellular organisms.},

	abstract = {We examined codon usage in Bacillus subtilis genes by multivariate analysis, quantified its cellular levels of individual tRNAs, and found a clear constraint of tRNA contents on synonymous codon choice. Individual tRNA levels were proportional to the copy number of the respective tRNA genes. This indicates that the tRNA gene copy number is an important factor to determine in cellular tRNA levels, which is common with Escherichia coli and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Codon usage in 18 unicellular organisms whose genomes have been sequenced completely was analyzed and compared with the composition of tRNA genes. The 18 organisms are as follows: yeast S. cerevisiae, Aquifex aeolicus, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, B. subtilis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Rickettsia prowazekii, Synechocystis sp., and Treponema pallidum. Codons preferred in highly expressed genes were related to the codons optimal for the translation process, which were predicted by the composition of isoaccepting tRNA genes. Genes with specific codon usage are discussed in connection with their evolutionary origins and functions. The origin and terminus of replication could be predicted on the basis of codon usage when the usage was analyzed relative to the transcription direction of individual genes.},

We found that each amino acid contributes about equally and highly significantly to overall codon usage bias, with the exception of Asp which had very low contribution to overall bias. Asp was also the only amino acid that did not show a clear preference for one of its synonymous codons. Synonymous codon usage in Drosophila was consistent with ``optimal'' codons deduced from the isoaccepting tRNA availability. Interestingly, amino acids whose major isoaccepting tRNAs change during development did not show as strong bias as those with developmentally unchanged tRNA pools. Asp is the only amino acid for which the major isoaccepting tRNAs change between larval and adult stages. We conclude that synonymous codon usage in Drosophila is well explained by tRNA availability and is probably influenced by developmental changes in relative abundance.},

A sufficiently high degree of resolution was obtained for 44 out of 46 tRNA species inE. colito be resolved into individual electrophoretic components. These isolated components were identified by hybridization to tRNA-specific oligonucle otide probes. Systematic measurements of the abundance of each individual tRNA isoacceptor inE. coli, grown at rates varying from 0.4 to 2.5 doublings per hour, were made with the aid of this electrophoretic protocol. We find that there is a biased distribution of the tRNA abundance at all growth rates, and that this can be roughly correlated with the values of codon frequencies in the mRNA pools calculated for bacteria growing at different rates. The tRNA species cognate to abundant codons increase in concentration as the growth rate increases but not as dramatically as might be anticipated. The levels of most of the tRNA isoacceptors cognate to less abundant codons remain unchanged with increasing growth rates. The result of these changes in tRNA abundance is that the relative increase in the amounts of major tRNA species in the bacteria growing at the fastest growth rates is more modest than previous estimates from this laboratory suggested. Furthermore, a systematic error in previous estimates of ribosomal RNA content of the bacteria has been detected. This will account for the quantitative discrepancies between the previous and the present data for tRNA abundance.},

The combination of high-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) with mutation-accumulation (MA) experiments has provided a powerful approach to genome-wide mutation analysis, though insights into mutational variation have been limited by the vast evolutionary distances among the few species analyzed. We performed a HTS analysis of MA lines derived from four Caenorhabditis nematode natural genotypes: C. elegans N2 and PB306 and C. briggsae HK104 and PB800. Total mutation rates did not differ among the four sets of MA lines. A mutational bias toward G:C→A:T transitions and G:C→T:A transversions was observed in all four sets of MA lines. Chromosome-specific rates were mostly stable, though there was some evidence for a slightly elevated X chromosome mutation rate in PB306. Rates were homogeneous among functional coding sequence types and across autosomal cores, arms, and tips. Mutation spectra were similar among the four MA line sets but differed significantly when compared with patterns of natural base-substitution polymorphism for 13/14 comparisons performed. Our findings show that base-substitution mutation processes in these closely related animal lineages are mostly stable but differ from natural polymorphism patterns in these two species.},

Shared DNA sequence features adapt CGIs for promoter function by destabilizing nucleosomes and attracting proteins that create a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state. Silencing of CGI promoters is achieved through dense CpG methylation or polycomb recruitment, again using their distinctive DNA sequence composition. CGIs are therefore generically equipped to influence local chromatin structure and simplify regulation of gene activity.},

Similar to Fugu rubripes , a marine pufferfish proposed by Brenner et al.3 as a model for genomic studies, T. nigroviridis is a more practical alternative4 with a genome also eight times more compact than that of human. Many comparisons have been made between F. rubripes and human DNA that demonstrate the potential of comparative genomics using the pufferfish genome5. Application of Exofish to the December version of the working draft sequence of the human genome and to Unigene showed that the human genome contains 28,000–34,000 genes, and that Unigene contains less than 40\% of the protein-coding fraction of the human genome.},

Despite its centrality to all things biological, the mutation rate (per nucleotide site per generation) ranges over three orders of magnitude among species and several‐fold within individual phylogenetic lineages. Within all major organismal groups, mutation rates scale negatively with the effective population size of a species and with the amount of functional DNA in the genome. This relationship is most parsimoniously explained by the drift‐barrier hypothesis, which postulates that natural selection typically operates to reduce mutation rates until further improvement is thwarted by the power of random genetic drift. Despite this constraint, the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA replication fidelity and repair are free to wander, provided the performance of the entire system is maintained at the prevailing level. The evolutionary flexibility of the mutation rate bears on the resolution of several prior conundrums in phylogenetic and population‐genetic analysis and raises challenges for future applications in these areas.},

	abstract = {Amino acids evolve at different speeds within protein sequences, because their functional and structural roles are different. Notably, amino acids located at the surface of proteins are known to evolve more rapidly than those in the core. In particular, amino acids at the N- and C-termini of protein sequences are likely to be more exposed than those at the core of the folded protein due to their location in the peptidic chain, and they are known to be less structured. Because of these reasons, we would expect that amino acids located at protein termini would evolve faster than residues located inside the chain. Here we test this hypothesis and found that amino acids evolve almost twice as fast at protein termini compared with those in the center, hinting at a strong topological bias along the sequence length. We further show that the distribution of solvent-accessible residues and functional domains in proteins readily explain how structural and functional constraints are weaker at their termini, leading to the observed excess of amino acid substitutions. Finally, we show that the specific evolutionary rates at protein termini may have direct consequences, notably misleading in silico methods used to infer sites under positive selection within genes. These results suggest that accounting for positional information should improve evolutionary models.},

However, an accurate estimation of the ribosome location depends on identifying the A-site from ribosome profiling reads, a problem that was previously unsolved. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the ribosome A-site positions from high-coverage ribosome profiling reads. Our model allows more reads to be used, accurately explains the 3-nt periodicity of ribosome profiling reads from various lengths, and recovers consistent ribosome positions across different lengths. Our recovered ribosome positions are correctly highly skewed toward a single frame within a codon. They retain subcodon resolution and enable detection of off-frame translational events, such as frameshifts. Our method improves the correlation with other estimates of codon decoding time. Furthermore, the refined profiles show that yeast wobble-pairing codons are translated slower than their synonymous Watson–Crick-pairing codons. These results provide evidence that protein synthetic rate can be tuned by codon usage bias.},

Up to now, a systematic examination of the codon usage for the chicken genome has not been performed. Here, we carried out a whole genome analysis of the chicken genome by the use of the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) method and identified 11 putative optimal codons, all of them ending with uracil (U), which is significantly departing from the pattern observed in other eukaryotes. Optimal codons in the chicken genome are most likely the ones corresponding to highly expressed transfer RNA (tRNAs) or tRNA gene copy numbers in the cell. Codon bias, measured as the frequency of optimal codons (Fop), is negatively correlated with the G + C content, recombination rate, but positively correlated with gene expression, protein length, gene length and intron length. The positive correlation between codon bias and protein, gene and intron length is quite different from other multi-cellular organism, as this trend has been only found in unicellular organisms. Our data displayed that regional G + C content explains a large proportion of the variance of codon bias in chicken. Stepwise selection model analyses indicate that G + C content of coding sequence is the most important factor for codon bias. It appears that variation in the G + C content of CDSs accounts for over 60\% of the variation of codon bias. This study suggests that both mutation bias and selection contribute to codon bias. However, mutation bias is the driving force of the codon usage in the Gallus gallus genome. Our data also provide evidence that the negative correlation between codon bias and recombination rates in G. gallus is determined mostly by recombination-dependent mutational patterns.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Although the mechanisms driving genome size evolution have not yet been fully deciphered, one potentially important factor is the dynamic of accumulation in mobile selfish genetic elements named transposable elements (TEs). Because the majority of these sequences are neutral or slightly deleterious, a negative correlation between genome size and selection efficacy is expected. Nevertheless, previous studies relying on empirical data from closely related species have yielded inconsistent conclusions, leaving this matter contentious. Here, we reconstructed a phylogeny based on whole genome data (2,242 genes) for 82 lineages representing 77 Drosophilid species. We studied correlations between genome size, TE content and measures of selection efficacy. We highlighted a strong phylogenetic inertia on genome size, and confirmed that TEs are the major components of the genome size. Using an integrative approach controlling for shared history, we found genome-wide ratios of non-synonymous over synonymous divergence (
            dN/dS
            ) to be strongly positively correlated to genome size and TE content, especially in GC poor genes. This work provides evidence for TE proliferation in the genome of flies when purifying selection is reduced and the genetic drift is increased. In the end, this study emphasizes the critical importance of controlling for GC heterogeneity when testing for the controversial correlation between evolutionary rates and genome size.},

	abstract = {Animal genomes exhibit a remarkable variation in size, but the evolutionary forces responsible for such variation are still debated. As the effective population size (Ne) reflects the intensity of genetic drift, it is expected to be a key determinant of the fixation rate of nearly-neutral mutations. Accordingly, the Mutational Hazard Hypothesis postulates lineages with low Ne to have bigger genome sizes due to the accumulation of slightly deleterious transposable elements (TEs), and those with high Ne to maintain streamlined genomes as a consequence of a more effective selection against TEs. However, the existence of both empirical confirmation and refutation using different methods and different scales precludes its general validation. Using high-quality public data, we estimated genome size, TE content and rate of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) as Ne proxy for 807 species including vertebrates, molluscs and insects. After collecting available life-history traits, we tested the associations among population size proxies, TE content and genome size, while accounting for phylogenetic non-independence. Our results confirm TEs as major drivers of genome size variation, and endorse life-history traits and dN/dS as reliable proxies for Ne. However, we do not find any evidence for increased drift to result in an accumulation of TEs across animals. Within more closely related clades, only a few isolated and weak associations emerge in fishes and birds. Our results outline a scenario where TE dynamics vary according to lineage-specific patterns, lending no support for genetic drift as the predominant force driving long-term genome size evolution in animals.},

	abstract = {The method to estimate contemporary effective population size (Ne) based on patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) at unlinked loci has been widely applied to natural and managed populations. The underlying model makes many simplifying assumptions, most of which have been evaluated in numerous studies published over the last two decades. Here, these performance evaluations are reviewed and summarized, with a focus on information that facilitates practical application to real populations in nature. Potential sources of bias that are discussed include calculation of r2 (a measure of LD), adjustments for sampling error, physical linkage, age structure, migration and spatial structure, mutation and selection, mating systems, changes in abundance, rare alleles, missing data, genotyping errors, data filtering choices and methods for combining multiple Ne estimates. Factors that affect precision are reviewed, including pseudoreplication that limits the information gained from large genomics datasets, constraints imposed by small samples of individuals, and the challenges in obtaining robust estimates for large populations. Topics that merit further research include the potential to weight r2 values by allele frequency, lump samples of individuals, use genotypic likelihoods rather than called genotypes, prune large LD values and apply the method to species practising partial monogamy.},

DNA methylation regulates gene expression by recruiting proteins involved in gene repression or by inhibiting the binding of transcription factor(s) to DNA. During development, the pattern of DNA methylation in the genome changes as a result of a dynamic process involving both de novo DNA methylation and demethylation. As a consequence, differentiated cells develop a stable and unique DNA methylation pattern that regulates tissue-specific gene transcription. In this chapter, we will review the process of DNA methylation and demethylation in the nervous system. We will describe the DNA (de)methylation machinery and its association with other epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications and noncoding RNAs. Intriguingly, postmitotic neurons still express DNA methyltransferases and components involved in DNA demethylation. Moreover, neuronal activity can modulate their pattern of DNA methylation in response to physiological and environmental stimuli. The precise regulation of DNA methylation is essential for normal cognitive function. Indeed, when DNA methylation is altered as a result of developmental mutations or environmental risk factors, such as drug exposure and neural injury, mental impairment is a common side effect. The investigation into DNA methylation continues to show a rich and complex picture about epigenetic gene regulation in the central nervous system and provides possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

Drawing on biographical and archival sources as well as on an analysis of the contemporaneous reception of these ideas this papers attempts to tease out some of the theoretical, methodological, and sociological factors that led, ultimately, to a more or less wholesale rejection of Darwinism in archaeology in the middle part of the 20 th century. Whilst 19 th -century scholars were trained in a range of disciplines and so able to work interdisciplinarily with ease, the increasing fragmentation of domains of enquiry and the parallel and rapid increase in the volume of scientific knowledge resulted in barriers to the integration of the social and evolutionary sciences. There remains much confusion about the remit and scope of an evolutionary analysis of material culture change. An undue focus on natural selection and a continued adherence to a typological view of material culture are particular barriers to a better and broader integration of evolutionary theory and archaeology. This historical analysis is presented in the hope of clearing up some of these misunderstandings and to contribute to a sharper definition of evolutionary archaeology.},

This resource encompasses data for 1,507 eukaryotic species, including 1,414 animals and 93 green plants, and is organized in three components. The first two components contain approximations of the effective population size, which serve as indicators of the extent of random genetic drift within each species. In the first component, we meticulously investigated public databases to assemble data on life history traits such as longevity, adult body length and body mass for a set of 969 species. The second component includes estimations of the ratio between the rate of non-synonymous substitutions and the rate of synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) in protein-coding sequences for 1,324 species. This ratio provides an estimate of the efficiency of natural selection in purging deleterious substitutions. The third component encompasses various genomic and transcriptomic characteristics. With this component, we aim to facilitate comparative transcriptomics analyses across species, by providing easy-to-use processed data for more than 16,000 RNA-seq samples across 491 species. These data include intron-centered alternative splicing frequencies, gene expression levels and sequencing depth statistics for each species, obtained with a homogeneous analysis protocol. To enable cross-species comparisons, we provide orthology predictions for conserved single-copy genes based on BUSCO gene sets. To illustrate the possible uses of this database, we identify the most frequently used introns for each gene and we assess how the sequencing depth available for each species affects our power to identify major and minor splice variants.},

	abstract = {Mechanisms underlying the dramatic patterns of genome size variation across the tree of life remain mysterious. Effective population size (Ne) has been proposed as a major driver of genome size: selection is expected to efficiently weed out deleterious mutations increasing genome size in lineages with large (but not small) Ne. Strong support for this model was claimed from a comparative analysis of Neu and genome size for ≈30 phylogenetically diverse species ranging from bacteria to vertebrates, but analyses at that scale have so far failed to account for phylogenetic nonindependence of species. In our reanalysis, accounting for phylogenetic history substantially altered the perceived strength of the relationship between Neu and genomic attributes: there were no statistically significant associations between Neu and gene number, intron size, intron number, the half-life of gene duplicates, transposon number, transposons as a fraction of the genome, or overall genome size. We conclude that current datasets do not support the hypothesis of a mechanistic connection between Ne and these genomic attributes, and we suggest that further progress requires larger datasets, phylogenetic comparative methods, more robust estimators of genetic drift, and a multivariate approach that accounts for correlations between putative explanatory variables., Genome size (the amount of nuclear DNA) varies tremendously across organisms but is not necessarily correlated with organismal complexity. For example, genome sizes just within the grasses vary nearly 20-fold, but large-genomed grass species are not obviously more complex in terms of morphology or physiology than are the small-genomed species. Recent explanations for genome size variation have instead been dominated by the idea that population size determines genome size: mutations that increase genome size are expected to drift to fixation in species with small populations, but such mutations would be eliminated in species with large populations where natural selection operates at higher efficiency. However, inferences from previous analyses are limited because they fail to recognize that species share evolutionary histories and thus are not necessarily statistically independent. Our analysis takes a phylogenetic perspective and, contrary to previous studies, finds no evidence that genome size or any of its components (e.g., transposon number, intron number) are related to population size. We suggest that genome size evolution is unlikely to be neatly explained by a single factor such as population size.},

The key innovation of these holometabolous insects is a pupal stage between the larva and adult when most structures are completely rebuilt. Why this extreme lifestyle evolved is unclear. Here we test the hypothesis that a trade-off between growth and differentiation explains the evolution of this novelty. Using a comparative approach, we find that holometabolous insects grow much faster than hemimetabolous insects. Using a theoretical model, we then show how holometaboly evolves under a growth-differentiation trade-off and identify conditions under which such temporal decoupling of growth and differentiation is favored. Our work supports the notion that the holometabolous life history evolved to remove developmental constraints on fast growth, primarily under high mortality.},

	abstract = {Although translational selection to favour codons that match the most abundant tRNAs is not readily observed in humans, there is nonetheless selection in humans on synonymous mutations. We hypothesize that much of this synonymous site selection can be explained in terms of protection against unwanted RNAs — spurious transcripts, mis-spliced forms or RNAs derived from transposable elements or viruses. We propose not only that selection on synonymous sites functions to reduce the rate of creation of unwanted transcripts (for example, through selection on exonic splice enhancers and cryptic splice sites) but also that high-GC content (but low-CpG content), together with intron presence and position, is both particular to functional native mRNAs and used to recognize transcripts as native. In support of this hypothesis, transcription, nuclear export, liquid phase condensation and RNA degradation have all recently been shown to promote GC-rich transcripts and suppress AU/CpG-rich ones. With such ‘traps’ being set against AU/CpG-rich transcripts, the codon usage of native genes has, in turn, evolved to avoid such suppression. That parallel filters against AU/CpG-rich transcripts also affect the endosomal import of RNAs further supports the unwanted transcript hypothesis of synonymous site selection and explains the similar design rules that have enabled the successful use of transgenes and RNA vaccines.},

The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method.

(2) With datasets routinely available today (10–20 loci with 10 alleles; 50 individuals), precise estimates can be obtained for relatively small populations (Ne {\textless} 200), and small populations are not likely to be mistaken for large ones. However, it is very difficult to obtain reliable estimates for large populations.

Among eukaryotes this is exemplified by yeast, where synonymous codon usage patterns are shaped by selection for particular codons that are more efficiently and/or accurately translated by the most abundant tRNAs; codon usage across the genome, and the abundance of different tRNA species, are highly co-adapted. Second, in the absence of selection, silent sites reveal underlying mutational patterns. Codon usage varies enormously among human genes, and yet silent sites do not appear to be influenced by natural selection, suggesting that mutation patterns vary among regions of the genome. At first, the yeast and human genomes were thought to reflect a dichotomy between unicellular and multicellular organisms. However, it now appears that natural selection shapes codon usage in some multicellular species (e.g. Drosophila and Caenorhabditis), and that regional variations in mutation biases occur in yeast. Silent sites (in serine codons) also provide evidence for mutational events changing adjacent nucleotides simultaneously.},

Instead, those genes with high G+C content at silent sites, resulting from a strong "preference" for a particular subset of the codons that are mostly C-ending, appear to be the more highly expressed genes. This suggests that G+C content is reduced in sequences where selective constraints are weaker, as indeed seen in a pseudogene.

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.93629.1},
	abstract = {Most eukaryotic genes undergo alternative splicing (AS), but the overall functional significance of this process remains a controversial issue. It has been noticed that the complexity of organisms (assayed by the number of distinct cell types) correlates positively with their genome-wide AS rate. This has been interpreted as evidence that AS plays an important role in adaptive evolution by increasing the functional repertoires of genomes. However, this observation also fits with a totally opposite interpretation: given that ‘complex’ organisms tend to have small effective population sizes (N e), they are expected to be more affected by genetic drift, and hence more prone to accumulate deleterious mutations that decrease splicing accuracy. Thus, according to this “drift barrier” theory, the elevated AS rate in complex organisms might simply result from a higher splicing error rate. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 3,496 transcriptome sequencing samples to quantify AS in 53 metazoan species spanning a wide range of N e values. Our results show a negative correlation between N e proxies and the genome-wide AS rates among species, consistent with the drift barrier hypothesis. This pattern is dominated by low abundance isoforms, which represent the vast majority of the splice variant repertoire. We show that these low abundance isoforms are depleted in functional AS events, and most likely correspond to errors. Conversely, the AS rate of abundant isoforms, which are relatively enriched in functional AS events, tends to be lower in more complex species. All these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that variation in AS rates across metazoans reflects the limits set by drift on the capacity of selection to prevent gene expression errors.},

	abstract = {The human genome is revisited using exon and intron distribution profiles. The 26,564 annotated genes in the human genome (build October, 2003) contain 233,785 exons and 207,344 introns. On average, there are 8.8 exons and 7.8 introns per gene. About 80\% of the exons on each chromosome are {\textless} 200 bp in length. {\textless} 0.01\% of the introns are {\textless} 20 bp in length and {\textless} 10\% of introns are more than 11,000 bp in length. These results suggest constraints on the splicing machinery to splice out very long or very short introns and provide insight to optimal intron length selection. Interestingly, the total length in introns and intergenic DNA on each chromosome is significantly correlated to the determined chromosome size with a coefficient of correlation r = 0.95 and r = 0.97, respectively. These results suggest their implication in genome design.},

	abstract = {The intron has been a big biological mystery since it was first discovered in several aspects. First, all of the completely sequenced eukaryotes harbor introns in the genomic structure, whereas no prokaryotes identified so far carry introns. Second, the amount of total introns varies in different species. Third, the length and number of introns vary in different genes, even within the same species genome. Fourth, all introns are copied into RNAs by transcription and DNAs by replication processes, but intron sequences do not participate in protein-coding sequences. The existence of introns in the genome should be a burden to some cells, because cells have to consume a great deal of energy to copy and excise them exactly at the correct positions with the help of complicated spliceosomal machineries. The existence throughout the long evolutionary history is explained, only if selective advantages of carrying introns are assumed to be given to cells to overcome the negative effect of introns. In that regard, we summarize previous research about the functional roles or benefits of introns. Additionally, several other studies strongly suggesting that introns should not be junk will be introduced.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary pressures on proteins are often quantified by the ratio of substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites. The dN/dS ratio was originally developed for application to distantly diverged sequences, the differences among which represent substitutions that have fixed along independent lineages. Nevertheless, the dN/dS measure is often applied to sequences sampled from a single population, the differences among which represent segregating polymorphisms. Here, we study the expected dN/dS ratio for samples drawn from a single population under selection, and we find that in this context, dN/dS is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. Moreover, the hallmark signature of positive selection over divergent lineages, dN/dS{\textgreater}1, is violated within a population. For population samples, the relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic function, and so it may be impossible to infer selection pressures from dN/dS. These results have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples., Since the time of Darwin, biologists have worked to identify instances of evolutionary adaptation. At the molecular scale, it is understood that adaptation should induce more genetic changes at amino acid altering sites in the genome, compared to amino acid–preserving sites. The ratio of substitution rates at such sites, denoted dN/dS, is therefore commonly used to detect proteins undergoing adaptation. This test was originally developed for application to distantly diverged genetic sequences, the differences among which represent substitutions along independent evolutionary lineages. Nonetheless, the dN/dS statistics are also frequently applied to genetic sequences sampled from a single population, the differences among which represent transient polymorphisms, not substitutions. Here, we show that the behavior of the dN/dS statistic is very different in these two cases. In particular, when applied to sequences from a single population, the dN/dS ratio is relatively insensitive to the strength of natural selection, and the anticipated signature of adaptive evolution, dN/dS{\textgreater}1, is violated. These results have implications for the interpretation of genetic variation sampled from a population. In particular, these results suggest that microbes may experience substantially stronger selective forces than previously thought.},

Furthermore, estimated rates of amino acid substitutions based on comparisons of the alpha hemoglobin chains of various mammals with that of the carp are about the same as those based on comparisons of the carp alpha and mammalian beta or the alpha and beta chains in mammals. These uniformities are regarded as evidence for the hypothesis that a majority of amino acid substitutions that occurred in these proteins are the result of random fixation of selectively neutral or nearly neutral mutations.
Two implications of this possibility are discussed: (a) Random gene frequency drift is playing an important role in determining the genetic structure of biological populations and (b) genes in “living fossils” may be expected to have undergone as many DNA base (and therefore amino acid) substitutions as corresponding genes (proteins) in more rapidly evolving species.},

They used the technique of gel electrophoresis of enzymes and proteins to study variation in natural populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura, at a set of loci that had been chosen purely for technical convenience, without prior knowledge of their levels of variability. Together with the independent study of human populations by Harry Harris, this seminal study provided the first relatively unbiased picture of the extent of genetic variability in protein sequences within populations, revealing that many genes had surprisingly high levels of diversity. These papers stimulated a large research program that found similarly high electrophoretic variability in many different species and led to statistical tools for interpreting the data in terms of population genetics processes such as genetic drift, balancing and purifying selection, and the effects of selection on linked variants. The current use of whole-genome sequences in studies of variation is the direct descendant of this pioneering work.},

Specific examples are selected to illustrate the emerging pattern of how these signals are formed by the mRNA and the key RNA-binding proteins. The signals are usually restricted to relatively short regions of the 3'UTR, but their precise nature varies, with both sequence and structure playing key roles. Repeat motifs and functional redundancy also appear as common features of these signals. The trans-acting factors involved in localisation include proteins having other roles in nuclear events, proteins that shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and translational factors. In addition, there is evidence of homology among these proteins and the mechanisms of localisation across eukaryotic species.},

This induces critical conformational changes in the heart of the enzyme that trigger termination. Termination can also occur at variable positions along the gene and so prevent aberrant transcript formation or intentionally make different transcripts. These may form multiple messenger RNAs with altered regulatory properties or encode different proteins. Finally, termination can be perturbed to achieve particular cellular needs or blocked in cancer or virally infected cells. In such cases, failure to terminate transcription can spell disaster for the cell.},

The downstream signal (135 bp) appears to act by pausing the elongating polymerase. TRO analysis indicates that elevated levels of transcribing polymerases accumulate over the DSE and that removal of this signal leads to transcription proceeding beyond the normal termination region. Furthermore, when inserted between two competing polyadenylation signals, this DSE increases the utilization of upstream poly(A) sites in vivo.

	abstract = {Extensive alternative splicing (AS) of precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) in multicellular eukaryotes increases the protein-coding capacity of a genome and allows novel ways to regulate gene expression. In flowering plants, up to 48\% of intron-containing genes exhibit AS. However, the full extent of AS in plants is not yet known, as only a few high-throughput RNA-Seq studies have been performed. As the cost of obtaining RNA-Seq reads continues to fall, it is anticipated that huge amounts of plant sequence data will accumulate and help in obtaining a more complete picture of AS in plants. Although it is not an onerous task to obtain hundreds of millions of reads using high-throughput sequencing technologies, computational tools to accurately predict and visualize AS are still being developed and refined. This review will discuss the tools to predict and visualize transcriptome-wide AS in plants using short-reads and highlight their limitations. Comparative studies of AS events between plants and animals have revealed that there are major differences in the most prevalent types of AS events, suggesting that plants and animals differ in the way they recognize exons and introns. Extensive studies have been performed in animals to identify cis-elements involved in regulating AS, especially in exon skipping. However, few such studies have been carried out in plants. Here, we review the current state of research on splicing regulatory elements (SREs) and briefly discuss emerging experimental and computational tools to identify cis-elements involved in regulation of AS in plants. The availability of curated alternative splice forms in plants makes it possible to use computational tools to predict SREs involved in AS regulation, which can then be verified experimentally. Such studies will permit identification of plant-specific features involved in AS regulation and contribute to deciphering the splicing code in plants.},

	abstract = {Natural selection on codon usage is a pervasive force that acts on a large variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Despite this, obtaining reliable estimates of selection on codon usage has proved complicated, perhaps due to the fact that the selection coefficients involved are very small. In this work, a population genetics model is used to measure the strength of selected codon usage bias, S, in 10 eukaryotic genomes. It is shown that the strength of selection is closely linked to expression and that reliable estimates of selection coefficients can only be obtained for genes with very similar expression levels. We compare the strength of selected codon usage for orthologous genes across all 10 genomes classified according to expression categories. Fungi genomes present the largest S values (2.24–2.56), whereas multicellular invertebrate and plant genomes present more moderate values (0.61–1.91). The large mammalian genomes (human and mouse) show low S values (0.22–0.51) for the most highly expressed genes. This might not be evidence for selection in these organisms as the technique used here to estimate S does not properly account for nucleotide composition heterogeneity along such genomes. The relationship between estimated S values and empirical estimates of population size is presented here for the first time. It is shown, as theoretically expected, that population size has an important role in the operativity of translational selection.},

An objective dimension of quality that is readily measurable is completeness of reporting, as transparency can improve the reader’s ability to independently interpret data and reproduce findings. In this observational study, we initially compared independent samples of articles published in bioRxiv and in PubMed-indexed journals in 2016 using a quality of reporting questionnaire. After that, we performed paired comparisons between preprints from bioRxiv to their own peer-reviewed versions in journals. Peer-reviewed articles had, on average, higher quality of reporting than preprints, although the difference was small, with absolute differences of 5.0\% [95\% CI 1.4, 8.6] and 4.7\% [95\% CI 2.4, 7.0] of reported items in the independent samples and paired sample comparison, respectively. There were larger differences favoring peer-reviewed articles in subjective ratings of how clearly titles and abstracts presented the main findings and how easy it was to locate relevant reporting information. Changes in reporting from preprints to peer-reviewed versions did not correlate with the impact factor of the publication venue or with the time lag from bioRxiv to journal publication. Our results suggest that, on average, publication in a peer-reviewed journal is associated with improvement in quality of reporting. They also show that quality of reporting in preprints in the life sciences is within a similar range as that of peer-reviewed articles, albeit slightly lower on average, supporting the idea that preprints should be considered valid scientific contributions.},

	abstract = {Peer review represents the primary mechanism used by funding agencies to allocate financial support and by journals to select manuscripts for publication, yet recent Cochrane reviews determined literature on peer review best practice is sparse. Key to improving the process are reduction of inherent vulnerability to high degree of randomness and, from an economic perspective, limiting both the substantial indirect costs related to reviewer time invested and direct administrative costs to funding agencies, publishers and research institutions. Use of additional reviewers per application may increase reliability and decision consistency, but adds to overall cost and burden. The optimal number of reviewers per application, while not known, is thought to vary with accuracy of judges or evaluation methods. Here I use bootstrapping of replicated peer review data from a Post-doctoral Fellowships competition to show that five reviewers per application represents a practical optimum which avoids large random effects evident when fewer reviewers are used, a point where additional reviewers at increasing cost provides only diminishing incremental gains in chance-corrected consistency of decision outcomes. Random effects were most evident in the relative mid-range of competitiveness. Results support aggressive high- and low-end stratification or triaging of applications for subsequent stages of review, with the proportion and set of mid-range submissions to be retained for further consideration being dependent on overall success rate.},

	abstract = {Nature uses 64 codons to encode the synthesis of proteins from the genome, and chooses 1 sense codon—out of up to 6 synonyms—to encode each amino acid. Synonymous codon choice has diverse and important roles, and many synonymous substitutions are detrimental. Here we demonstrate that the number of codons used to encode the canonical amino acids can be reduced, through the genome-wide substitution of target codons by defined synonyms. We create a variant of Escherichia coli with a four-megabase synthetic genome through a high-fidelity convergent total synthesis. Our synthetic genome implements a defined recoding and refactoring scheme—with simple corrections at just seven positions—to replace every known occurrence of two sense codons and a stop codon in the genome. Thus, we recode 18,214 codons to create an organism with a 61-codon genome; this organism uses 59 codons to encode the 20 amino acids, and enables the deletion of a previously essential transfer RNA.},

	abstract = {Species diverge eco-morphologically through the continuous action of natural selection on functionally important structures, producing alternative adaptive morphologies. In cichlid fishes, the oral and pharyngeal jaws are such key structures. Adaptive variation in jaw morphology contributes to trophic specialization, which is hypothesized to fuel their rapid speciation in the East African Great Lakes. Much is known about the genes involved in cichlid jaw and craniofacial development. However, it is still unclear what salient sources of variation gave rise to trophic-niche specialization, facilitating adaptive radiation. Here, we explore two sources of transcriptional variation that may underlie species-specific disparities in jaw morphology. Using whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing, we analyze differences in gene expression and alternative splicing, at the end of postlarval development, in fully functional jaws of six species of cichlids from the Lake Tanganyika tribe Tropheini. Our data reveal a surprisingly high degree of alternative splicing events compared with gene expression differences among species and trophic types. This suggests that differential trophic adaptation of the jaw apparatus may have been shaped by transcriptional rewiring of splicing as well as gene expression variation during the rapid radiation of the Tropheini. Specifically, genes undergoing splicing across most species were found to be enriched for pharyngeal jaw gene ontology terms. Overall, jaw transcriptional patterns at postlarval developmental stage were highly dynamic and species-specific. In conclusion, this work indicates that shifts in alternative splicing could have played a more important role in cichlid adaptive radiation, and possibly adaptive radiation in general, than currently recognized.},

Aberrant alternative splicing can lead to various neurological diseases and cancers and is responsible for aging, infection, inflammation, immune and metabolic disorders, and so on. Though aberrant alternative splicing events and their regulatory mechanisms are widely recognized, the association between autoimmune disease and alternative splicing has not been extensively examined. Autoimmune diseases are characterized by the loss of tolerance of the immune system towards self-antigens and organ-specific or systemic inflammation and subsequent tissue damage. In the present review, we summarized the most recent reports on splicing events that occur in the immunopathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and attempted to clarify the role that splicing events play in regulating autoimmune disease progression. We also identified the changes that occur in splicing factor expression. The foregoing information might improve our understanding of autoimmune diseases and help develop new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for them.},

Thousands of novel, lineage-specific and conserved alternative exons were identified; widely conserved alternative exons had signatures of binding by MBNL, PTB, RBFOX, STAR and TIA family splicing factors, implicating them as ancestral mammalian splicing regulators.

This is achieved by multiple mechanisms that modulate the quantitative composition and the diversity of the molecular inventory. Molecular diversification is particularly pronounced on the proteome level, at which multiple proteoforms derived from the same gene can in turn combinatorially form different protein complexes, thus expanding the repertoire of functional modules in the cell. The study of molecular and modular diversity and their involvement in responses to changing conditions has only recently become possible through the development of new ‘omics’-based screening technologies. This Review explores our current knowledge of the mechanisms regulating functional diversification along the axis of gene expression, with a focus on the proteome and interactome. We explore the interdependence between different molecular levels and how this contributes to functional diversity. Finally, we highlight several recent techniques for studying molecular diversity, with specific focus on mass spectrometry-based analysis of the proteome and its organization into functional modules, and examine future directions for this rapidly growing field.},

To date, large-scale investigations into the pattern of transcript expression across distinct tissues have produced contradictory results. Here, we attempt to determine whether genes express a dominant splice variant at the protein level. We interrogate peptides from eight large-scale human proteomics experiments and databases and find that there is a single dominant protein isoform, irrespective of tissue or cell type, for the vast majority of the protein-coding genes in these experiments, in partial agreement with the conclusions from the most recent large-scale RNAseq study. Remarkably, the dominant isoforms from the experimental proteomics analyses coincided overwhelmingly with the reference isoforms selected by two completely orthogonal sources, the consensus coding sequence variants, which are agreed upon by separate manual genome curation teams, and the principal isoforms from the APPRIS database, predicted automatically from the conservation of protein sequence, structure, and function.,},

To date, over 100 000 isoforms have been detected in EST libraries, and at least 75\% of human genes have at least one alternative isoform. In this paper, we propose that most alternative splicing events are the result of noise in the splicing process. We show that the number of isoforms and their abundance can be predicted by a simple stochastic noise model that takes into account two factors: the number of introns in a gene and the expression level of a gene. The results strongly support the hypothesis that most alternative splicing is a consequence of stochastic noise in the splicing machinery, and has no functional significance. The results are also consistent with error rates tuned to ensure that an adequate level of functional product is produced and to reduce the toxic effect of accumulation of misfolding proteins. Based on simulation of sampling of virtual cDNA libraries, we estimate that error rates range from 1 to 10\% depending on the number of introns and the expression level of a gene.},

Recent transcriptome-wide analysis of AS using RNA sequencing has revealed that AS is highly pervasive in plants. Pre-mRNAs from over 60\% of intron-containing genes undergo AS to produce a vast repertoire of mRNA isoforms. The functions of most splice variants are unknown. However, emerging evidence indicates that splice variants increase the functional diversity of proteins. Furthermore, AS is coupled to transcript stability and translation through nonsense-mediated decay and microRNA-mediated gene regulation. Widespread changes in AS in response to developmental cues and stresses suggest a role for regulated splicing in plant development and stress responses. Here, we review recent progress in uncovering the extent and complexity of the AS landscape in plants, its regulation, and the roles of AS in gene regulation. The prevalence of AS in plants has raised many new questions that require additional studies. New tools based on recent technological advances are allowing genome-wide analysis of RNA elements in transcripts and of chromatin modifications that regulate AS. Application of these tools in plants will provide significant new insights into AS regulation and crosstalk between AS and other layers of gene regulation.},

To ensure scalability, multiple sequence alignment computation benefits from a new and efficient segmentation strategy, allowing a massive speedup. CONSENT compares well to the state-of-the-art, and performs better on real Oxford Nanopore data. Specifically, CONSENT is the only method that efficiently scales to ultra-long reads, and allows to process a full human dataset, containing reads reaching up to 1.5 Mbp, in 10 days. Moreover, our experiments show that error correction with CONSENT improves the quality of Flye assemblies. Additionally, CONSENT implements a polishing feature, allowing to correct raw assemblies. Our experiments show that CONSENT is 2-38x times faster than other polishing tools, while providing comparable results. Furthermore, we show that, on a human dataset, assembling the raw data and polishing the assembly is less resource consuming than correcting and then assembling the reads, while providing better results.

	abstract = {The reproducibility crisis has highlighted the importance of improving the way bioinformatics data analyses are implemented, executed, and shared. To address this, various tools such as content versioning systems, workflow management systems, and software environment management systems have been developed. While these tools are becoming more widely used, there is still much work to be done to increase their adoption. The most effective way to ensure reproducibility becomes a standard part of most bioinformatics data analysis projects is to integrate it into the curriculum of bioinformatics Master’s programs.In this article, we present the Reprohackathon, a Master’s course that we have been running for the last 3 years at Université Paris-Saclay (France), and that has been attended by a total of 123 students. The course is divided into two parts. The first part includes lessons on the challenges related to reproducibility, content versioning systems, container management, and workflow systems. In the second part, students work on a data analysis project for 3–4 months, reanalyzing data from a previously published study. The Reprohackaton has taught us many valuable lessons, such as the fact that implementing reproducible analyses is a complex and challenging task that requires significant effort. However, providing in-depth teaching of the concepts and the tools during a Master’s degree program greatly improves students’ understanding and abilities in this area.},

While the majority of introns in humans are U2 type, less than 0.4\% are U12 type, also known as minor introns (mi-INTs), and require a specialized spliceosome composed of U11, U12, U4atac, U5, and U6atac snRNPs. The high evolutionary conservation and apparent splicing inefficiency of U12 introns have set them apart from their major counterparts and led to speculations on the purpose for their existence. However, recent studies challenged the simple concept of mi-INTs splicing inefficiency due to low abundance of their spliceosome and confirmed their regulatory role in alternative splicing, significantly impacting the expression of their host genes. Additionally, a growing list of minor spliceosome-associated diseases with tissue-specific pathologies affirmed the importance of minor splicing as a key regulatory pathway, which when deregulated could lead to tissue-specific pathologies due to specific alterations in the expression of some minor-intron-containing genes. Consequently, uncovering how mi-INTs splicing is regulated in a tissue-specific manner would allow for better understanding of disease pathogenesis and pave the way for novel therapies, which we highlight in this review.},

Strikingly, this “trans-inducibility” can be achieved by simply changing the codon-usage of acute virus glycoproteins to that of persistent herpesvirus glycoproteins with herpesviral trans-inducer. Here, we apply the “persistent viral codon-usage-trans-inducer” principle to SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA vaccine platform, in which the codon-usage of Spike is changed to that of Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein B (gB) with its “trans-inducer” ICP27. The HSVgB-ICP27-codon-optimized Spike mRNA vaccine induced markedly high antigen expression and stability, total IgG, neutralizing antibody, and T cell response, ultimately enhancing protection against lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Moreover, the HSVgB- codon-optimized Delta (B.1.617.2) strain Spike mRNA vaccine provided significant enhancements in antigen expression and long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Thus, we report a novel persistent viral codon-usage-trans-inducer mRNA vaccine platform for enhanced antigen expression and long-term protection against lethal viral infection.},

	abstract = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are being used to combat the spread of COVID-19 (refs. –), but they still exhibit critical limitations caused by mRNA instability and degradation, which are major obstacles for the storage, distribution and efficacy of the vaccine products. Increasing secondary structure lengthens mRNA half-life, which, together with optimal codons, improves protein expression. Therefore, a principled mRNA design algorithm must optimize both structural stability and codon usage. However, owing to synonymous codons, the mRNA design space is prohibitively large—for example, there are around 2.4 × 10632 candidate mRNA sequences for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This poses insurmountable computational challenges. Here we provide a simple and unexpected solution using the classical concept of lattice parsing in computational linguistics, where finding the optimal mRNA sequence is analogous to identifying the most likely sentence among similar-sounding alternatives. Our algorithm LinearDesign finds an optimal mRNA design for the spike protein in just 11 minutes, and can concurrently optimize stability and codon usage. LinearDesign substantially improves mRNA half-life and protein expression, and profoundly increases antibody titre by up to 128 times in mice compared to the codon-optimization benchmark on mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 and varicella-zoster virus. This result reveals the great potential of principled mRNA design and enables the exploration of previously unreachable but highly stable and efficient designs. Our work is a timely tool for vaccines and other mRNA-based medicines encoding therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies and anti-cancer drugs,., An algorithm based on concepts established in computational linguistics enables rapid principled design of mRNA vaccines optimizing both structural stability and codon usage, resulting in improved half-life, protein expression and immune responses.},

Synonymous mutations introduced into the protein coding region tolerate modifications in DNA or mRNA without modifying the encoded proteins. Synonymous genome-wide recoding has allowed the synthetic generation of different small-genome viruses with modified phenotypes and biological properties. Recently, a decreased cost of chemically synthesizing DNA and improved methods for assembling DNA fragments (e.g. lambda red recombination and CRISPR-based editing) have enabled the construction of an Escherichia coli variant with a 4-Mb synthetic synonymously recoded genome with a reduced number of sense codons (n = 59) encoding the 20 canonical amino acids. Synonymous genome recoding is increasing our knowledge of microbial interactions with innate immune responses, identifying functional genome structures, and strategically ameliorating cis-inhibitory signaling sequences related to splicing, replication (in eukaryotes), and complex microbe functions, unraveling the relevance of codon usage for the temporal regulation of gene expression and the microbe mutant spectrum and adaptability. New biotechnological and therapeutic applications of this methodology can easily be envisaged. In this review, we discuss how synonymous genome recoding may impact our knowledge of microbial biology and the development of new and better therapeutic methodologies.},

The basis for genome recoding strategy is genetic code variation that can be harnessed to improve cellular properties. Thus, genome recoding is a promising strategy for the enhancement of genome flexibility, allowing for novel functions that are not commonly documented in the organism in its natural environment. Here, the basic concept of genetic code and associated mechanisms for the generation of genetic codon variants, including biased codon usage, codon reassignment, and ambiguous decoding, are extensively discussed. Knowledge of the concept of natural genetic code expansion is also detailed. The generation of recoded organisms and associated mechanisms with basic targeting components, including aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase–tRNA pairs, elongation factor EF-Tu and ribosomes, are highlighted for a comprehensive understanding of this concept. The research associated with the generation of diverse recoded organisms is also discussed. The success of genome recoding in diverse multicellular organisms offers a platform for expanding protein chemistry at the biochemical level with non-canonical amino acids, genetically isolating the synthetic organisms from the natural ones, and fighting viruses, including SARS-CoV2, through the creation of attenuated viruses. In conclusion, genome recoding can offer diverse applications for improving cellular properties in the genome-recoded organisms.},

	abstract = {The acceleration of DNA sequencing in samples from patients and population studies has resulted in extensive catalogues of human genetic variation, but the interpretation of rare genetic variants remains problematic. A notable example of this challenge is the existence of disruptive variants in dosage-sensitive disease genes, even in apparently healthy individuals. Here, by manual curation of putative loss-of-function (pLoF) variants in haploinsufficient disease genes in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)1, we show that one explanation for this paradox involves alternative splicing of mRNA, which allows exons of a gene to be expressed at varying levels across different cell types. Currently, no existing annotation tool systematically incorporates information about exon expression into the interpretation of variants. We develop a transcript-level annotation metric known as the ‘proportion expressed across transcripts’, which quantifies isoform expression for variants. We calculate this metric using 11,706 tissue samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project2 and show that it can differentiate between weakly and highly evolutionarily conserved exons, a proxy for functional importance. We demonstrate that expression-based annotation selectively filters 22.8\% of falsely annotated pLoF variants found in haploinsufficient disease genes in gnomAD, while removing less than 4\% of high-confidence pathogenic variants in the same genes. Finally, we apply our expression filter to the analysis of de novo variants in patients with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability or developmental disorders to show that pLoF variants in weakly expressed regions have similar effect sizes to those of synonymous variants, whereas pLoF variants in highly expressed exons are most strongly enriched among cases. Our annotation is fast, flexible and generalizable, making it possible for any variant file to be annotated with any isoform expression dataset, and will be valuable for the genetic diagnosis of rare diseases, the analysis of rare variant burden in complex disorders, and the curation and prioritization of variants in recall-by-genotype studies.},

From plants to humans, AS is a powerful process that increases transcriptome complexity. Importantly, splice variants produced from AS can potentially encode for distinct protein isoforms which can lose or gain specific domains and, hence, differ in their functional properties. Advances in proteomics have shown that the proteome is indeed diverse due to the presence of numerous protein isoforms. For the past decades, with the help of advanced high-throughput technologies, numerous alternatively spliced transcripts have been identified. However, the low detection rate of protein isoforms in proteomic studies raised debatable questions on whether AS contributes to proteomic diversity and on how many AS events are really functional. We propose here to assess and discuss the impact of AS on proteomic complexity in the light of the technological progress, updated genome annotation, and current scientific knowledge.},

	abstract = {Recent genomewide analyses of alternative splicing (AS) indicate that up to 70\% of human genes may have alternative splice forms, suggesting that AS together with various posttranslational modifications plays a major role in the production of proteome complexity. Splice-site selection under normal physiological conditions is regulated in the developmental stage in a tissue type-specific manner by changing the concentrations and the activity of splicing regulatory proteins. Whereas spliceosomal errors resulting in the production of aberrant transcripts rarely occur in normal cells, they seem to be an intrinsic property of cancer cells. Changes in splice-site selection have been observed in various types of cancer and may affect genes implicated in tumor progression (for example, CD44, MDM2, and FHIT) and in susceptibility to cancer (for example, BRCA1 and APC). Splicing defects can arise from inherited or somatic mutations in cis-acting regulatory elements (splice donor, acceptor and branch sites, and exonic and intronic splicing enhancers and silencers) or variations in the composition, concentration, localization, and activity of regulatory proteins. This may lead to altered efficiency of splice-site recognition, resulting in overexpression or down-regulation of certain splice variants, a switch in splice-site usage, or failure to recognize splice sites correctly, resulting in cancer-specific splice forms. At least in some cases, changes in splicing have been shown to play a functionally significant role in tumorigenesis, either by inactivating tumor suppressors or by gain of function of proteins promoting tumor development. Moreover, cancer-specific splicing events may generate novel epitopes that can be recognized by the host's immune system as cancer specific and may serve as targets for immunotherapy. Thus, the identification of cancer-specific splice forms provides a novel source for the discovery of diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and tumor antigens suitable as targets for therapeutic intervention.},

	abstract = {The immense majority of genes are alternatively spliced and there are many isoforms specifically associated with cancer progression and metastasis. The splicing pattern of specific isoforms of numerous genes is altered as cells move through the oncogenic process of gaining proliferative capacity, acquiring angiogenic, invasive, antiapoptotic and survival properties, becoming free from growth factor dependence and growth suppression, altering their metabolism to cope with hypoxia, enabling them to acquire mechanisms of immune escape, and as they move through the epithelial-mesenchymal and mesenchymal-epithelial transitions and metastasis. Each of the 'hallmarks of cancer' is associated with a switch in splicing, towards a more aggressive invasive cancer phenotype. The choice of isoforms is regulated by several factors (signaling molecules, kinases, splicing factors) currently being identified systematically by a number of high-throughput, independent and unbiased methodologies. Splicing factors are de-regulated in cancer, and in some cases are themselves oncogenes or pseudo-oncogenes and can contribute to positive feedback loops driving cancer progression. Tumour progression may therefore be associated with a coordinated splicing control, meaning that there is the potential for a relatively small number of splice factors or their regulators to drive multiple oncogenic processes. The understanding of how splicing contributes to the various phenotypic traits acquired by tumours as they progress and metastasise, and in particular how alternative splicing is coordinated, can and is leading to the development of a new class of anticancer therapeutics-the alternative-splicing inhibitors.},

It adds another regulation layer of gene expression. Up to 95\% of human multi-exon genes undergo alternative splicing to encode proteins with different functions. Moreover, around 15\% of human hereditary diseases and cancers are associated with alternative splicing. Regulation of alternative splicing is attributed to a set of delicate machineries interacting with each other in aid of important biological processes such as cell development and differentiation. Given the importance of alternative splicing events, their accurate mapping and quantification are paramount for downstream analysis, especially for associating disease with alternative splicing. However, deriving accurate isoform expression from high-throughput RNA-seq data remains a challenging task. In this mini-review, we aim to illustrate I) mechanisms and regulation of alternative splicing, II) alternative splicing associated human disease, III) computational tools for the quantification of isoforms and alternative splicing from RNA-seq.},

Because neutral diversity depends upon the product of the effective population size and mutation rate, there is an expectation that diversity should be correlated to measures of census population size. This correlation is often observed for nuclear but not for mitochondrial DNA. Here, we revisit the question of whether mitochondrial DNA sequence diversity is correlated to census population size by compiling the largest data set to date, using 639 mammalian species. In a multiple regression, we find that nucleotide diversity is significantly correlated to both range size and mass-specific metabolic rate, but not a variety of other factors. We also find that a measure of the effective population size, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous diversity, is also significantly negatively correlated to both range size and mass-specific metabolic rate. These results together suggest that species with larger ranges have larger effective population sizes. The slope of the relationship between diversity and range is such that doubling the range increases diversity by 12–20\%, providing one of the first quantifications of the relationship between diversity and the census population size.},

It intends to mimic a naturally occurring infection while avoiding the disease, exposing our bodies to viral antigens to trigger an immune response that will protect us from future infections. Among different strategies for vaccine development, recombinant vaccines are one of the most efficient ones. Recombinant vaccines use safe viral vectors as vehicles and incorporate a transgenic antigen of the pathogen against which we intend to generate an immune response. These vaccines can be based on replication-deficient viruses or replication-competent viruses. While the most effective strategy involves replication-competent viruses, they must be attenuated to prevent any health hazard while guaranteeing a strong humoral and cellular immune response. Several attenuation strategies for adenoviral-based vaccine development have been contemplated over time. In this paper, we will review them and discuss novel approaches based on the principle that protein synthesis from individual genes can be modulated by codon usage bias manipulation. We will summarize vaccine approaches that consider recoding of viral proteins to produce adenoviral attenuation and recoding of the transgene antigens for both viral attenuation and efficient viral epitope expression.},

	abstract = {Genetic stochasticity due to small population size contributes to population extinction, especially when population fragmentation disrupts gene flow. Estimates of effective population size (Ne) can therefore be informative about population persistence, but there is a need for an assessment of their consistency and informative relevance. Here we review the body of empirical estimates of Ne for wild populations obtained with the temporal genetic method and published since Frankham's (1995) review. Theoretical considerations have identified important sources of bias for this analytical approach, and we use empirical data to investigate the extent of these biases. We find that particularly model selection and sampling require more attention in future studies. We report a median unbiased Ne estimate of 260 (among 83 studies) and find that this median estimate tends to be smaller for populations of conservation concern, which may therefore be more sensitive to genetic stochasticity. Furthermore, we report a median Ne/N ratio of 0.14, and find that this ratio may actually be higher for small populations, suggesting changes in biological interactions at low population abundances. We confirm the role of gene flow in countering genetic stochasticity by finding that Ne correlates strongest with neutral genetic metrics when populations can be considered isolated. This underlines the importance of gene flow for the estimation of Ne, and of population connectivity for conservation in general. Reductions in contemporary gene flow due to ongoing habitat fragmentation will likely increase the prevalence of genetic stochasticity, which should therefore remain a focal point in the conservation of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Pacific salmon are semelparous but have overlapping year classes, which presents special challenges for the application of standard population genetics theory to these species. This article examines the relationship between the effective number of breeders per year (Nb) and single-generation and multigeneration effective population size (Ne) in salmon populations that fluctuate in size. A simple analytical model is developed that allows calculation of Ne on the basis of the number of spawners in individual years and their reproductive contribution (productivity) to the next generation. Application of the model to a 36-year time series of data for a threatened population of Snake River chinook salmon suggests that variation in population dynamic processes across years reduced the multigeneration Ne by ∼40–60\%, and reductions may have been substantially greater within some generations. These reductions are comparable in magnitude to, and in addition to, reductions in Nb within a year due to unequal sex ratio and nonrandom variation in reproductive success. Computer simulations suggest that the effects of variable population dynamics on Ne observed in this dataset are not unexpected for species with a salmon life history, as random variation in productivity can lead to similar results.},

	abstract = {With an ecological-evolutionary perspective increasingly applied toward the conservation and management of endangered or exploited species, the genetic estimation of effective population size (Ne) has proliferated. Based on a comprehensive analysis of empirical literature from the past two decades, we asked: (i) how often do studies link Ne to the adult census population size (N)? (ii) To what extent is Ne correctly linked to N? (iii) How readily is uncertainty accounted for in both Ne and N when quantifying Ne/N ratios? and (iv) how frequently and to what degree might errors in the estimation of Ne or N affect inferences of Ne/N ratios? We found that only 20\% of available Ne estimates (508 of 2617; 233 studies) explicitly attempted to link Ne and N; of these, only 31\% (160 of 508) correctly linked Ne and N. Moreover, only 7\% (41 of 508) of Ne/N ratios (correctly linked or not) reported confidence intervals for both Ne and N; for those cases where confidence intervals were reported for Ne only, 31\% of Ne/N ratios overlapped with 1, of which more than half also reached below Ne/N = 0.01. Uncertainty in Ne/N ratios thus sometimes spanned at least two orders of magnitude. We conclude that the estimation of Ne/N ratios in natural populations could be significantly improved, discuss several options for doing so, and briefly outline some future research directions.},

	abstract = {Across diverse taxa, selfing species have evolved independently from outcrossing species thousands of times. The transition from outcrossing to selfing decreases the effective population size, effective recombination rate and heterozygosity within a species. These changes lead to a reduction in genetic diversity, and therefore adaptive potential, by intensifying the effects of random genetic drift and linked selection. Within the nematode genus Caenorhabditis, selfing has evolved at least three times, and all three species, including the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, show substantially reduced genetic diversity relative to outcrossing species. Selfing and outcrossing Caenorhabditis species are often found in the same niches, but we still do not know how selfing species with limited genetic diversity can adapt to these environments. Here, we examine the whole-genome sequences from 609 wild C. elegans strains isolated worldwide and show that genetic variation is concentrated in punctuated hyper-divergent regions that cover 20\% of the C. elegans reference genome. These regions are enriched in environmental response genes that mediate sensory perception, pathogen response and xenobiotic stress response. Population genomic evidence suggests that genetic diversity in these regions has been maintained by long-term balancing selection. Using long-read genome assemblies for 15 wild strains, we show that hyper-divergent haplotypes contain unique sets of genes and show levels of divergence comparable to levels found between Caenorhabditis species that diverged millions of years ago. These results provide an example of how species can avoid the evolutionary dead end associated with selfing.},

All tRNA genes were assigned to 42 classes of distinct codon specificity. Accordingly, four deviations from previously proposed rules for third position wobble pairing in yeast, three G:U and one A:I codon-anticodon pairings, were found to be required to account for the reading of 61 coding triplets. The gene copy number for individual tRNA species, which ranges from one to 16, correlates well with both the frequency of codon occurrence in a sample of 1756 distinct protein coding sequences (r=0.82) and the previously measured intracellular content of 21 tRNA species. A close link between tRNA gene redundancy and the overall amino acid composition of yeast proteins was also observed. Regression analysis values for individual protein coding sequences proved to be effective descriptions of the translational selective pressure operating on a particular gene. A significantly stronger co-adaptation between codon choice and tRNA gene copy number was observed in highly expressed genes. These observations strongly support the notion that intracellular tRNA levels in normally growing yeast cells are mainly determined by gene copy number, which, along with codon choice, is the key parameter acted upon by translational selection.},

How good any of these measures is for correlating codon usage with gene and protein expression has yet to be investigated. In this study, we correlated gene transcript levels in Escherichia coli with codon usage, using a number of different codon bias measures.

B., H. Robins, and A. J. Levine. 2004. Tissue-specific codon usage and the expression of human genes. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101:12588-12591.) To test this model, we analyzed by internal correspondence analysis the codon usage of 2,126 human tissue-specific genes expressed in 18 different tissues. We confirm that synonymous codon usage differs significantly between the tissues. However, the effect is very weak: the variability of synonymous codon usage between tissues represents only 2.3\% of the total codon usage variability. Moreover, this variability is directly linked to isochore-scale ({\textgreater}100 kb) variability of GC-content that affect both coding and introns or intergenic regions. This demonstrates that variations of synonymous codon usage between tissue-specific genes expressed in different tissues are due to regional variations of substitution patterns and not to translational selection.},

Synonymous codons can modulate protein production and folding, but the mechanism connecting codon usage to protein homeostasis is not known. Here we show that synonymous codon variants in the gene encoding gamma-B crystallin, a mammalian eye lens protein, modulate the rates of translation and co-translational folding of protein domains monitored in real time by Förster resonance energy transfer and fluorescence intensity changes. Gamma-B crystallins produced from mRNAs with changed codon bias have the same amino acid sequence, but attain different conformations as indicated by altered in vivo stability and in vitro protease resistance. 2D NMR spectroscopic data suggest that structural differences are associated with different cysteine oxidation states of the purified proteins, providing a link between translation, folding, and the structures of isolated proteins. Thus, synonymous codons provide a secondary code for protein folding in the cell.,},

Cotranslational folding mechanisms are therefore linked to elongation rate, which varies as a function of synonymous codon usage. However, synonymous codon substitutions can affect many distinct cellular processes, which has complicated attempts to deconvolve the extent to which synonymous codon usage can promote or frustrate proper protein folding in vivo. Although previous studies have shown that some synonymous changes can lead to different final structures, other substitutions will likely be more subtle, perturbing predominantly the protein folding pathway without radically altering the final structure. Here we show that synonymous codon substitutions encoding a single essential enzyme lead to dramatically slower cell growth. These mutations do not prevent active enzyme formation; instead, they predominantly alter the protein folding mechanism, leading to enhanced degradation in vivo. These results support a model in which synonymous codon substitutions can impair cell fitness by significantly perturbing cotranslational protein folding mechanisms, despite the chaperoning provided by the cellular protein homeostasis network.},

Rare codons in KRAS suppress its protein expression, which has been shown to affect both normal and cancer biology in mammals. Here, using HRAS or KRAS expression in different human cell lines and in vitro transcription and translation assays, we show that KRAS rare codons inhibit both translation efficiency and transcription and that the contribution of these two processes varies among different cell lines. We observed that codon usage regulates mRNA translation efficiency such that WT KRAS mRNA is poorly translated. On the other hand, common codons increased transcriptional rates by promoting activating histone modifications and recruitment of transcriptional coactivators. Finally, we found that codon usage also influences KRAS protein conformation, likely because of its effect on co-translational protein folding. Together, our results reveal that codon usage has multidimensional effects on protein expression, ranging from effects on transcription to protein folding in human cells.},

One mechanism linking translation efficiency and codon use is that slower decoding is coupled to reduced mRNA stability. tRNA supply mediates biological regulation: changes in tRNA amounts facilitate cancer metastasis.},

In addition, codon usage biases result in nonuniform ribosome decoding rates on mRNAs, which in turn influence the cotranslational protein folding process that is critical for protein function in diverse biological processes. Conserved genome-wide correlations have also been found between codon usage and protein structures.

We further demonstrate that far-downstream mutations can also modulate mRNA levels by occluding the SD sequence through the formation of non-equilibrium secondary structures. By contrast, a non-endogenous RNA polymerase that decouples transcription and translation largely alleviates the effects of synonymous substitutions on mRNA levels. Finally, a complementary statistical analysis of the E. coli genome specifically implicates avoidance of intra-molecular base pairing with the SD sequence.

Several hypotheses have been proposed on the relationship between the nucleotide sequence, encoded amino acid sequence and mRNA secondary structure. We performed the first transcriptome-wide in silico analysis of the human and mouse mRNA foldings and found a pronounced periodic pattern of nucleotide involvement in mRNA secondary structure. We show that this pattern is created by the structure of the genetic code, and the dinucleotide relative abundances are important for the maintenance of mRNA secondary structure. Although synonymous codon usage contributes to this pattern, it is intrinsic to the structure of the genetic code and manifests itself even in the absence of synonymous codon usage bias at the 4-fold degenerate sites. While all codon sites are important for the maintenance of mRNA secondary structure, degeneracy of the code allows regulation of stability and periodicity of mRNA secondary structure. We demonstrate that the third degenerate codon sites contribute most strongly to mRNA stability. These results convincingly support the hypothesis that redundancies in the genetic code allow transcripts to satisfy requirements for both protein structure and RNA structure. Our data show that selection may be operating on synonymous codons to maintain a more stable and ordered mRNA secondary structure, which is likely to be important for transcript stability and translation. We also demonstrate that functional domains of the mRNA [5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR), CDS and 3′-UTR] preferentially fold onto themselves, while the start codon and stop codon regions are characterized by relaxed secondary structures, which may facilitate initiation and termination of translation.},

The rate of synonymous substitution between E.coli and Salmonella typhimurium is substantially reduced near the start of the gene, which suggests the presence of an additional selection pressure which competes with the selection for codons which are most rapidly translated. Possible competing sources of selection are the presence of secondary ribosome binding sites downstream from the start codon, the avoidance of mRNA secondary structure near the start of the gene and the use of sub-optimal codons to regulate gene expression. We provide evidence against the last of these possibilities. We also show that there is a decrease in the frequency of A, and an increase in the frequency of G along the E.coli genes at all three codon positions. We argue that these results are most consistent with selection to avoid mRNA secondary structure.},

Recently, however, codon usage was shown to affect transcription of fungal and mammalian genes, indicating the existence of a gene regulatory phenomenon with unknown mechanism. In Neurospora, codon usage biases strongly correlate with mRNA levels genome-wide, and here we show that the correlation between codon usage and RNA levels is maintained in the nucleus. In addition, codon optimality is tightly correlated with both total and nuclear RNA levels, suggesting that codon usage broadly influences mRNA levels through transcription in a translation-independent manner. A large-scale RNA sequencing-based genetic screen in Neurospora identified 18 candidate factors that when deleted decreased the genome-wide correlation between codon usage and RNA levels and reduced the codon usage effect on gene expression. Most of these factors, such as the H3K36 methyltransferase, are chromatin regulators or transcription factors.

Current strategies to identify enhancers focus primarily on noncoding sequences and tend to exclude protein coding sequences. Here, we analyzed 25 available ChIP-seq data sets that identify enhancers in an unbiased manner (H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and EP300) for peaks that overlap exons. We find that, on average, 7\% of all ChIP-seq peaks overlap coding exons (after excluding for peaks that overlap with first exons). By using mouse and zebrafish enhancer assays, we demonstrate that several of these exonic enhancer (eExons) candidates can function as enhancers of their neighboring genes and that the exonic sequence is necessary for enhancer activity. Using ChIP, 3C, and DNA FISH, we further show that one of these exonic limb enhancers, Dync1i1 exon 15, has active enhancer marks and physically interacts with Dlx5/6 promoter regions 900 kb away. In addition, its removal by chromosomal abnormalities in humans could cause split hand and foot malformation 1 (SHFM1), a disorder associated with DLX5/6. These results demonstrate that DNA sequences can have a dual function, operating as coding exons in one tissue and enhancers of nearby gene(s) in another tissue, suggesting that phenotypes resulting from coding mutations could be caused not only by protein alteration but also by disrupting the regulation of another gene.},

In particular, we concentrate on how selection acting during the protein's production history can also affect protein evolutionary rates and amino acid choice. Exploring the role of selection at the DNA and RNA level, we specifically address how the need (i) to specify exonic splice enhancer motifs in pre-mRNA, and (ii) to ensure nucleosome positioning on DNA have an impact on amino acid choice and rates of evolution. For both, we review evidence that sequence affected by more than one coding demand is particularly constrained. Strikingly, in mammals, splicing-related constraints are quantitatively as important as expression parameters in predicting rates of protein evolution. These results indicate that there is substantially more to protein evolution than protein functional constraints.},

	abstract = {The {\textasciitilde}9.5 kilobase HIV-1 genome contains RNA sequences and structures that control many aspects of viral replication, including transcription, splicing, nuclear export, translation, packaging and reverse transcription. Nonetheless, chemical probing and other approaches suggest that the HIV-1 genome may contain many more RNA secondary structures of unknown importance and function. To determine whether there are additional, undiscovered cis-acting RNA elements in the HIV-1 genome that are important for viral replication, we undertook a global silent mutagenesis experiment. Sixteen mutant proviruses containing clusters of {\textasciitilde}50 to {\textasciitilde}200 synonymous mutations covering nearly the entire HIV-1 protein coding sequence were designed and synthesized. Analyses of these mutant viruses resulted in their division into three phenotypic groups. Group 1 mutants exhibited near wild-type replication, Group 2 mutants exhibited replication defects accompanied by perturbed RNA splicing, and Group 3 mutants had replication defects in the absence of obvious splicing perturbation. The three phenotypes were caused by mutations that exhibited a clear regional bias in their distribution along the viral genome, and those that caused replication defects all caused reductions in the level of unspliced RNA. We characterized in detail the underlying defects for Group 2 mutants. Second-site revertants that enabled viral replication could be derived for Group 2 mutants, and generally contained point mutations that reduced the utilization of proximal splice sites. Mapping of the changes responsible for splicing perturbations in Group 2 viruses revealed the presence of several RNA sequences that apparently suppressed the use of cryptic or canonical splice sites. Some sequences that affected splicing were diffusely distributed, while others could be mapped to discrete elements, proximal or distal to the affected splice site(s). Overall, our data indicate complex negative regulation of HIV-1 splicing by RNA elements in various regions of the HIV-1 genome that enable balanced splicing and viral replication., In addition to encoding viral proteins, the HIV-1 genome contains sequence elements that act at the level of RNA to enable replication. We undertook an experiment to discover new RNA elements that act in this way by altering nearly the entire coding sequence of the viral genome so as to change the RNA sequence without changing protein sequences. This experiment uncovered two classes of defective mutants. One class had profound defects in RNA splicing, the other had no obvious defects in splicing. Through an analysis of the splicing-defective mutants, we found several previously RNA sequences in the viral genome that affected splicing, enabling a nearly complete catalogue of signals that regulate HIV-1 alternative splicing in infected cells to be derived. Because these newly described sequences lack sequence motifs that are known to bind to canonical splicing-regulatory proteins, they may function through novel mechanisms.},

However, the conflict between ensuring splicing efficiency and preserving the coding capacity for an optimal protein during evolution has not been specifically analyzed. In fact, studies on genomic variability in fields as diverse as clinical genetics and molecular evolution mainly focus on the effect of mutations on protein function. Synonymous variations, in particular, are assumed to be functionally neutral both in clinical diagnosis and when measuring evolutionary distances between species. Using the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) exon 12 splicing as a model, we have established that about one quarter of synonymous variations result in exon skipping and, hence, in an inactive CFTR protein. Furthermore, comparative splicing evaluation of mammalian sequence divergences showed that artificial combinations of CFTR exon 12 synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions are incompatible with normal RNA processing. In particular, the combination of the mouse synonymous with the human missense variations causes exon skipping. It follows that there are two sequential levels at which evolutionary selection of genomic variants take place: splicing control and protein function optimization.},

We therefore inserted a small DNA fragment in the lacZ gene either directly or flanked by a few frame-shifting bases, leaving the reading frame of the lacZ gene unchanged. The fragment was chosen to have "infrequent" codons in one reading frame and "common" codons in the other. The insert in these constructs does not seem to give mRNAs that are able to form extensive secondary structures. The translation time for these modified lacZ mRNAs was measured with a reproducibility better than plus or minus one second. We found that the mRNA with infrequent codons inserted has an approximately three-seconds longer translation time than the one with common codons. In another set of experiments we constructed two almost identical lacZ genes in which the lacZ mRNAs have the potential to generate stem structures with stabilities of about -75 kcal/mol. In this way we could investigate the influence of mRNA structure on translation rate. This type of modified gene was generated in two reading frames with either common or infrequent codons similar to our first experiments. We find that the yield of protein from these mRNAs is reduced, probably due to the action in vivo of an RNase. Nevertheless, the data do not indicate that there is any effect of mRNA secondary structure on translation rate. In contrast, our data persuade us that there is a difference in translation rate between infrequent codons and common codons that is of the order of sixfold.},

In metazoans, these trends are strongest in tissues composed of neurons, whose structure and lifetime confer extreme sensitivity to protein misfolding. We propose, and demonstrate using a molecular-level evolutionary simulation, that selection against toxicity of misfolded proteins generated by ribosome errors suffices to create all the observed covariation. The mechanistic model of molecular evolution which emerges yields testable biochemical predictions, calls into question use of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratios (Ka/Ks) to detect functional selection, and suggests how mistranslation may contribute to neurodegenerative disease.},

	abstract = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) translation by the ribosome represents the ﬁnal step of a complicated molecular dance from DNA to protein. Although classically considered a decipherer that translates a 64-word genetic code into a proteome of astonishing complexity, the ribosome can also shape the transcriptome by controlling mRNA stability. Recent work has discovered that the ribosome is an arbiter of the general mRNA degradation pathway, wherein the ribosome transit rate serves as a major determinant of transcript half-lives. Speciﬁcally, members of the degradation complex sense ribosome translocation rates as a function of ribosome elongation rates. Central to this notion is the concept of codon optimality: although all codons impact translation rates, some are deciphered quickly, whereas others cause ribosome hesitation as a consequence of relative cognate tRNA concentration. These transient pauses induce a unique ribosome conformational state that is probed by the deadenylase complex, thereby inducing an orchestrated set of events that enhance both poly(A) shortening and cap removal. Together, these data imply that the coding region of an mRNA not only encodes for protein content but also impacts protein levels through determining the transcript’s fate.},

Overall, the codon content influences protein expression more strongly than mRNA-folding parameters, although the latter dominate in the initial {\textasciitilde}16 codons. Genes redesigned based on our analyses are transcribed with unaltered efficiency but translated with higher efficiency in vitro. The less efficiently translated native sequences show greatly reduced mRNA levels in vivo.

We identified RNA sequence determinants of toxicity and evolved suppressor strains that can tolerate the expression of toxic GFP variants.

We first estimate the distribution of selection coefficients from two large viral data sets under the assumption that the viral population size is the same along all lineages of the phylogeny and that the selection coefficients vary among sites. We then implement several new models in which the lineages of the phylogeny may have different population sizes. We apply the new models to a data set consisting of the coding regions from eight primate mitochondrial genomes.

	abstract = {Variations in gene expression have been widely explored in order to obtain an accurate overview of the changes in regulatory networks that underlie phenotypic diversity. Numerous studies have characterized differences in genomic expression between large numbers of individuals of model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To more broadly survey the evolution of the transcriptomic landscape across species, we measured whole-genome expression in a large collection of another yeast species: Lachancea kluyveri (formerly Saccharomyces kluyveri), using RNAseq. Interestingly, this species diverged from the S. cerevisiae lineage prior to its ancestral whole genome duplication. Moreover, L. kluyveri harbors a chromosome-scale compositional heterogeneity due to a 1-Mb ancestral introgressed region as well as a large set of unique unannotated genes. In this context, our comparative transcriptomic analysis clearly showed a link between gene evolutionary history and expression behavior. Indeed, genes that have been recently acquired or under function relaxation tend to be less transcribed show a higher intraspecific variation (plasticity) and are less involved in network (connectivity). Moreover, utilizing this approach in L. kluyveri also highlighted specific regulatory network signatures in aerobic respiration, amino-acid biosynthesis and glycosylation, presumably due to its different lifestyle. Our data set sheds an important light on the evolution of intraspecific transcriptomic variation across distant species.},

	abstract = {Much recent work has explored molecular and population-genetic constraints on the rate of protein sequence evolution. The best predictor of evolutionary rate is expression level, for reasons that have remained unexplained. Here, we hypothesize that selection to reduce the burden of protein misfolding will favor protein sequences with increased robustness to translational missense errors. Pressure for translational robustness increases with expression level and constrains sequence evolution. Using several sequenced yeast genomes, global expression and protein abundance data, and sets of paralogs traceable to an ancient whole-genome duplication in yeast, we rule out several confounding effects and show that expression level explains roughly half the variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein evolutionary rates. We examine causes for expression's dominant role and find that genome-wide tests favor the translational robustness explanation over existing hypotheses that invoke constraints on function or translational efficiency. Our results suggest that proteins evolve at rates largely unrelated to their functions and can explain why highly expressed proteins evolve slowly across the tree of life.},

Here we examined the theoretical relationship between ω, effective population size (Ne), and selection coefficient (s). Our analysis revealed that when purifying selection is high, ω of species with small Ne is much higher than that of species with large Ne. However the difference between the two ω reduces with the decline in selection pressure (s → 0). We examined this relationship using primate and rodent genes and found that the ω estimated for highly constrained genes of primates was up to 2.9 times higher than that obtained for their orthologous rodent genes. Conversely, for genes under weak purifying selection the ω of primates was only 17\% higher than that of rodents. When tissue specificity was used as a proxy for selection pressure we found that the ω of broadly expressed genes of primates was up to 2.1-fold higher than that of their rodent counterparts and this difference was only 27\% for tissue specific genes. Since most of the nonsynonymous mutations in constrained or broadly expressed genes are deleterious, fixation of these mutations is influenced by Ne. This results in a higher ω of these genes in primates compared to those from rodents. Conversely, the majority of nonsynonymous mutations in less-constrained or tissue-specific genes are neutral or nearly neutral and therefore fixation of them is largely independent of Ne, which leads to the similarity of ω in primates and rodents.},

	abstract = {Purifying selection is the most pervasive type of selection, as it constantly removes deleterious mutations arising in populations, directly scaling with population size. Highly expressed genes appear to accumulate fewer deleterious mutations between divergent species’ lineages, pointing towards gene expression as an additional driver of purifying selection. However, estimates of the effect of gene expression on segregating deleterious variants in natural populations are lacking, as well as an understanding of the relative contribution of population size and gene expression to overall purifying selection pressure. Here, we analyse genomic and transcriptomic data from two natural populations of closely related sister species with different demographic histories, the Emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri) and the King penguins (A. patagonicus), and demonstrate that purifying selection at the population-level depends on the level of gene expression, with larger effects than population size. Deleterious segregating variants spread less in the population when they are in genes with higher expression rate. Leveraging realistic forward simulations, we estimate that the top 10\% of the most highly expressed genes in a genome experience a selection pressure corresponding to an average selection coefficient of −0.1, which decreases to a selection coefficient of −0.01 for the top 50\%. Gene expression appears to be a fundamental driver of purifying selection in natural populations, also effective at small population size. We suggest gene expression could be used as a proxy for gene selection coefficients (i.e., distribution of fitness effects), which are notoriously difficult to derive in non-model species under real-world conditions.},

Here, we measured the fitness effect of almost all ({\textgreater}97.5\%) single-nucleotide mutations in GFP, an exogenous gene with no physiological function, and URA3, a conditionally essential gene. Both genes were driven by two promoters whose expression levels differed by around tenfold. The resulting fitness landscapes revealed that the fitness effects of at least 42\% of all single-nucleotide mutations within the genes were expression dependent. Although only a small fraction of variation in fitness effects among different mutations can be explained by biophysical properties of the protein and messenger RNA of the gene, our analyses revealed that the avoidance of stochastic molecular errors generally underlies the expression dependency of mutational effects and suggested protein misfolding as the most important type of molecular error among those examined. Our results therefore directly explained the slower evolution of highly expressed genes and highlighted cytotoxicity due to stochastic molecular errors as a non-negligible component for understanding the phenotypic consequence of mutations.},

	abstract = {The cause of the tremendous among-protein variation in the rate of sequence evolution is a central subject of molecular evolution. Expression level has been identified as a leading determinant of this variation among genes encoded in the same genome, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We here propose and demonstrate that a requirement for stronger folding of more abundant mRNAs results in slower evolution of more highly expressed genes and proteins. Specifically, we show that: (i) the higher the expression level of a gene, the greater the selective pressure for its mRNA to fold; (ii) random mutations are more likely to decrease mRNA folding when occurring in highly expressed genes than in lowly expressed genes; and (iii) amino acid substitution rate is negatively correlated with mRNA folding strength, with or without the control of expression level. Furthermore, synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) nucleotide substitution rates are both negatively correlated with mRNA folding strength. However, counterintuitively, dS and dN are differentially constrained by selection for mRNA folding, resulting in a significant correlation between mRNA folding strength and dN/dS, even when gene expression level is controlled. The direction and magnitude of this correlation is determined primarily by the G+C frequency at third codon positions. Together, these findings explain why highly expressed genes evolve slowly, demonstrate a major role of natural selection at the mRNA level in constraining protein evolution, and reveal a previously unrecognized and unexpected form of nonprotein-level selection that impacts dN/dS.},

Among these, the protein's expression level, functional category, essentiality, or metabolic costs of its amino acid residues may play an important role. However, the relative importance of each variable has not yet been evaluated in comparative analyses. To this aim, we made regression analyses combining data available on these variables and on evolutionary rates, in two well-documented model bacteria, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. In both bacteria, the level of expression of the protein in the cell was by far the most important driving force constraining the amino acids substitution rate. Subsequent inclusion in the analysis of the other variables added little further information. Furthermore, when the rates of synonymous substitutions were included in the analysis of the E. coli data, only the variable expression levels remained statistically significant. The rate of nonsynonymous substitution was shown to correlate with expression levels independently of the rate of synonymous substitution. These results suggest an important direct influence of expression levels, or at least codon usage bias for translation optimization, on the rates of nonsynonymous substitutions in bacteria. They also indicate that when a control for this variable is included, essentiality plays no significant role in the rate of protein evolution in bacteria, as is the case in eukaryotes.},

	abstract = {Evolving lineages face a constant intracellular threat: most new coding sequence mutations destabilize the folding of the encoded protein. Misfolded proteins form insoluble aggregates and are hypothesized to be intrinsically cytotoxic. Here, we experimentally isolate a fitness cost caused by toxicity of misfolded proteins. We exclude other costs of protein misfolding, such as loss of functional protein or attenuation of growth-limiting protein synthesis resources, by comparing growth rates of budding yeast expressing folded or misfolded variants of a gratuitous protein, YFP, at equal levels. We quantify a fitness cost that increases with misfolded protein abundance, up to as much as a 3.2\% growth rate reduction when misfolded YFP represents less than 0.1\% of total cellular protein. Comparable experiments on variants of the yeast gene orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase (URA3) produce similar results. Quantitative proteomic measurements reveal that, within the cell, misfolded YFP induces coordinated synthesis of interacting cytosolic chaperone proteins in the absence of a wider stress response, providing evidence for an evolved modular response to misfolded proteins in the cytosol. These results underscore the distinct and evolutionarily relevant molecular threat of protein misfolding, independent of protein function. Assuming that most misfolded proteins impose similar costs, yeast cells express almost all proteins at steady-state levels sufficient to expose their encoding genes to selection against misfolding, lending credibility to the recent suggestion that such selection imposes a global constraint on molecular evolution.},

Here, we show that this hypothesis does not fully explain the E-R anticorrelation, especially for protein surface residues. We propose that natural selection against protein–protein misinteraction, which wastes functional molecules and is potentially toxic, constrains the evolution of surface residues. Because highly expressed proteins are under stronger pressures to avoid misinteraction, surface residues are expected to show an E-R anticorrelation. Our molecular-level evolutionary simulation and yeast genomic analysis confirm multiple predictions of the hypothesis. These findings show a pluralistic origin of the E-R anticorrelation and reveal the role of protein misinteraction, an inherent property of complex cellular systems, in constraining protein evolution.},

This variation is thought to reflect differences in the proportion of the sequence that is critical to fulfill given functions (Li 1997), but local recombination intensity (Williams and Hurst 2000) might also have an influence. Recent analysis of mammalian genes has revealed another significant pattern: broadly expressed proteins (i.e., those expressed in many tissues) tend to evolve slower than tissue-specific ones (Kuma  et al. 1995; Hastings 1996; Duret and Mouchiroud 2000). A possible interpretation of these findings is that proteins expressed in many tissues interact with a greater number of molecules and may also have to function under widely changing cellular conditions. Hence, high pleiotropic constraints on these genes reduce sequence divergence (Kuma  et al. 1995; Hastings 1996; Duret and Mouchiroud 2000). This model can, however, be shown not to be a general explanation for the pattern if it is found in an organism without tissues. It also begs the question as to whether the rate, as well as breadth, of expression is a predictor of the rate of evolution.},

	abstract = {To determine whether gene expression patterns affect mutation rates and/or selection intensity in mammalian genes, we studied the relationships between substitution rates and tissue distribution of gene expression. For this purpose, we analyzed 2,400 human/rodent and 834 mouse/rat orthologous genes, and we measured (using expressed sequence tag data) their expression patterns in 19 tissues from three development states. We show that substitution rates at nonsynonymous sites are strongly negatively correlated with tissue distribution breadth: almost threefold lower in ubiquitous than in tissue-specific genes. Nonsynonymous substitution rates also vary considerably according to the tissues: the average rate is twofold lower in brain-, muscle-, retina- and neuron-specific genes than in lymphocyte-, lung-, and liver-specific genes. Interestingly, 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) show exactly the same trend. These results demonstrate that the expression pattern is an essential factor in determining the selective pressure on functional sites in both coding and noncoding regions. Conversely, silent substitution rates do not vary with expression pattern, even in ubiquitously expressed genes. This latter result thus suggests that synonymous codon usage is not constrained by selection in mammals. Furthermore, this result also indicates that there is no reduction of mutation rates in genes expressed in the germ line, contrary to what had been hypothesized based on the fact that transcribed DNA is more efficiently repaired than nontranscribed DNA.},

	abstract = {The “nearly neutral” theory of molecular evolution proposes that many features of genomes arise from the interaction of three weak evolutionary forces: mutation, genetic drift, and natural selection acting at its limit of efficacy. Such forces generally have little impact on allele frequencies within populations from generation to generation but can have substantial effects on long-term evolution. The evolutionary dynamics of weakly selected mutations are highly sensitive to population size, and near neutrality was initially proposed as an adjustment to the neutral theory to account for general patterns in available protein and DNA variation data. Here, we review the motivation for the nearly neutral theory, discuss the structure of the model and its predictions, and evaluate current empirical support for interactions among weak evolutionary forces in protein evolution. Near neutrality may be a prevalent mode of evolution across a range of functional categories of mutations and taxa. However, multiple evolutionary mechanisms (including adaptive evolution, linked selection, changes in fitness-effect distributions, and weak selection) can often explain the same patterns of genome variation. Strong parameter sensitivity remains a limitation of the nearly neutral model, and we discuss concave fitness functions as a plausible underlying basis for weak selection.},

	abstract = {Background
Genetic analyses of DNA sequences make use of an increasingly complex set of nucleotide substitution models to estimate the divergence between gene sequences. However, there is currently no way to assess the validity of nucleotide substitution models over short time-scales and with limited mutational accumulation.

Results
We show that quantifying the decline in the ratio of transitions to transversions (ti/tv) over time provides an in-built measure of mutational saturation and hence of substitution model accuracy. We tested this through detailed phylogenetic analyses of 10 representative virus data sets comprising recently sampled and closely related sequences. In the majority of cases our estimates of ti/tv decrease with time, even under sophisticated time-reversible models of nucleotide substitution. This indicates that high levels of saturation are attained extremely rapidly in viruses, sometimes within decades. In contrast, we did not find any temporal patterns in selection pressures or CG-content over these short time-frames. To validate the temporal trend of ti/tv across a broader taxonomic range, we analyzed a set of 76 different viruses. Again, the estimate of ti/tv scaled negatively with evolutionary time, a trend that was more pronounced for rapidly-evolving RNA viruses than slowly-evolving DNA viruses.

Conclusions
Our study shows that commonly used substitution models can underestimate the number of substitutions among closely related sequences, such that the time-scale of viral evolution and emergence may be systematically underestimated. In turn, estimates of ti/tv provide an effective internal control of substitution model performance in viruses because of their high sensitivity to mutational saturation.

	abstract = {Although mutation provides the fuel for phenotypic evolution, it also imposes a substantial burden on fitness through the production of predominantly deleterious alleles, a matter of concern from a human-health perspective. Here, recently established databases on de novo mutations for monogenic disorders are used to estimate the rate and molecular spectrum of spontaneously arising mutations and to derive a number of inferences with respect to eukaryotic genome evolution. Although the human per-generation mutation rate is exceptionally high, on a per-cell division basis, the human germline mutation rate is lower than that recorded for any other species. Comparison with data from other species demonstrates a universal mutational bias toward A/T composition, and leads to the hypothesis that genome-wide nucleotide composition generally evolves to the point at which the power of selection in favor of G/C is approximately balanced by the power of random genetic drift, such that variation in equilibrium genome-wide nucleotide composition is largely defined by variation in mutation biases. Quantification of the hazards associated with introns reveals that mutations at key splice-site residues are a major source of human mortality. Finally, a consideration of the long-term consequences of current human behavior for deleterious-mutation accumulation leads to the conclusion that a substantial reduction in human fitness can be expected over the next few centuries in industrialized societies unless novel means of genetic intervention are developed.},

The pattern of nucleotide substitutions in unconstrained sequences is expected to be congruent with the pattern of point mutation. We examined the retrotransposon Helena in the Drosophila virilis species group (subgenus Drosophila) and the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup (subgenus Sophophora). The patterns of point mutation are indistinguishable, suggesting considerable stability over evolutionary time (40–60 million years). The relative frequencies of different point mutations are unequal, but the “transition bias” results largely from an ≈2-fold excess of G⋅C to A⋅T substitutions. Spontaneous mutation is biased toward A⋅T base pairs, with an expected mutational equilibrium of ≈65\% A + T (quite similar to that of long introns). These data also enable the first detailed comparison of patterns of point mutations in Drosophila and mammals. Although the patterns are different, all of the statistical significance comes from a much greater rate of G⋅C to A⋅T substitution in mammals, probably because of methylated cytosine “hotspots.” When the G⋅C to A⋅T substitutions are discounted, the remaining differences are considerably reduced and not statistically significant.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The unavailability of intergenic region annotation in whole genome sequencing and pan-genomics hinders efforts to enhance crop improvement.
Objectives
Despite advances in research, the impact of post-transcriptional regulation on fiber development and translatome profiling at different stages of fiber growth in cotton (G. hirsutum) remains unexplored.
Methods
We utilized a combination of reference-guided de novo transcriptome assembly and ribosome profiling techniques to uncover the hidden mechanisms of translational control in eight distinct tissues of upland cotton.
Results
Our study identified P-site distribution at three-nucleotide periodicity and dominant ribosome footprint at 27 nucleotides. Specifically, we have detected 1,589 small open reading frames (sORFs), including 1,376 upstream ORFs (uORFs) and 213 downstream ORFs (dORFs), as well as 552 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with potential coding functions, which fine-tune the annotation of the cotton genome. Further, we have identified novel genes and lncRNAs with strong translation efficiency (TE), while sORFs were found to affect mRNA transcription levels during fiber elongation. The reliability of these findings was confirmed by the high consistency in correlation and synergetic fold change between RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and Ribosome-sequencing (Ribo-seq) analyses. Additionally, integrated omics analysis of the normal fiber ZM24 and short fiber pag1 cotton mutant revealed several differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and fiber-specific expressed (high/low) genes associated with sORFs (uORFs and dORFs). These findings were further supported by the overexpression and knockdown of GhKCS6, a gene associated with sORFs in cotton, and demonstrated the potential regulation of the mechanism governing fiber elongation on both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
Conclusion
Reference-guided transcriptome assembly and the identification of novel transcripts fine-tune the annotation of the cotton genome and predicted the landscape of fiber development. Our approach provided a high-throughput method, based on multi-omics, for discovering unannotated ORFs, hidden translational control, and complex regulatory mechanisms in crop plants.},

Thus each genome, or kind of genome, appears to possess a "system" for choosing between codons. Frameshift genes, however, have widely different choice strategies from normal genes. Our work indicates that the main factors distinguishing between mRNA sequences relate to choices among degenerate bases. These systematic third base choices can therefore be used to establish a new kind of genetic distance, which reflects differences in coding strategy. The choice patterns we find seem compatible with the idea that the genome and not the individual gene is the unit of selection.

Once engaged, 43S scanning occurs rapidly and directionally at \$100 nucleotides per second, independent of multiple cycles of ATP hydrolysis by RNA helicases post ribosomal loading. Scanning ribosomes can proceed through RNA secondary structures, but 50 UTR hairpin sequences near start codons drive scanning ribosomes at start codons backward in the 50 direction, requiring rescanning to arrive once more at a start codon.

Here we report evidence that three-quarters of the human genome is capable of being transcribed, as well as observations about the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates, regulatory regions and modifications of almost all currently annotated and thousands of previously unannotated RNAs.

Translational regulation has been intensively studied in the model dicot plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and in this study, we assessed the translational status [proportion of steady-state mRNA associated with ribosomes] of mRNAs by Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification followed by mRNA-sequencing (TRAP-seq) in rice (Oryza sativa), a model monocot plant and the most important food crop. A survey of three tissues found that most transcribed rice genes are translated whereas few transposable elements are associated with ribosomes. Genes with short and GC-rich coding regions are overrepresented in ribosome-associated mRNAs, suggesting that the GC-richness characteristic of coding sequences in grasses may be an adaptation that favors efficient translation. Transcripts with retained introns and extended 5′ untranslated regions are underrepresented on ribosomes, and rice genes belonging to different evolutionary lineages exhibited differential enrichment on the ribosomes that was associated with GC content. Genes involved in photosynthesis and stress responses are preferentially associated with ribosomes, whereas genes in epigenetic regulation pathways are the least enriched on ribosomes. Such variation is more dramatic in rice than that in Arabidopsis and is correlated with the wide variation of GC content of transcripts in rice. Taken together, variation in the translation status of individual transcripts reflects important mechanisms of gene regulation, which may have a role in evolution and diversification.},

Although many plant genomes have been sequenced, comprehensive translatomic annotations are not available for plants due to a lack of efﬁcient translatome proﬁling techniques. Here, we developed a new technique termed 30 ribosome-proﬁling sequencing (30Ribo-seq) for reliable, robust translatomic proﬁling. 30Ribo-seq combines polysome proﬁling and 30 selection with a barcoding and pooling strategy. Systematic translatome proﬁling of different tissues of Arabidopsis, rice, and maize using conventional ribosome proﬁling (Ribo-seq) and 30Ribo-seq revealed many novel translational genomic loci, thereby complementing functional genome annotation in plants. Using the low-cost, efﬁcient 30Ribo-seq technique and genome-wide association mapping of translatome expression (eGWAS), we performed a population-level dissection of the translatomes of 159 diverse maize inbred lines and identiﬁed 1,777 translational expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Notably, local eQTLs are signiﬁcantly enriched in the 30 untranslated regions of genes. Detailed eQTL analysis suggested that sequence variation around the polyadenylation (polyA) signal motif plays a key role in translatomic variation. Our study provides a comprehensive translatome annotation of plant functional genomes and introduces 30Ribo-seq, which paves the way for deep translatomic analysis at the population level.},

Transcriptional and translational elongation remain coordinated under various nutrient conditions, as previously reported.

Our data thus provide direct evidence that translation is not required to maintain the speed of transcriptional elongation.

PTT-mediated polarity caused by translation-targeting antibiotics substantially affected the coordinated expression of genes in several long operons, contributing to the key physiological effects of these antibiotics.

This study provides new insights into the changing transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients who are receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy (often life-long). Alternative splicing, vital for cellular homeostasis, is dysregulated in human cancers. Remarkably, we found abnormal splicing patterns despite molecular remission in peripheral blood cells of chronic-phase CML patients. This phenomenon is independent of the TKI drug used and in striking contrast to the normalisation of gene expression and DNA methylation patterns.

Abstract
Vast transcriptomics and epigenomics changes are characteristic of human cancers, including leukaemia. At remission, we assume that these changes normalise so that omics-profiles resemble those of healthy individuals. However, an in-depth transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of cancer remission has not been undertaken. A striking exemplar of targeted remission induction occurs in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) following tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Using RNA sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we profiled samples from chronic-phase CML patients at diagnosis and remission and compared these to healthy donors. Remarkably, our analyses revealed that abnormal splicing distinguishes remission samples from normal controls. This phenomenon is independent of the TKI drug used and in striking contrast to the normalisation of gene expression and DNA methylation patterns. Most remarkable are the high intron retention (IR) levels that even exceed those observed in the diagnosis samples. Increased IR affects cell cycle regulators at diagnosis and splicing regulators at remission. We show that aberrant splicing in CML is associated with reduced expression of specific splicing factors, histone modifications and reduced DNA methylation. Our results provide novel insights into the changing transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes of CML patients during remission. The conceptually unanticipated observation of widespread aberrant alternative splicing after remission induction warrants further exploration. These results have broad implications for studying CML relapse and treating minimal residual disease.},

We classified 86\% of over 1.36 million protein-coding genes from 40 vertebrates, 23 arthropods, and 32 fungi into orthologous groups and linked over 90\% of them to Gene Ontology or InterPro annotations. Quantifying properties of ortholog phyletic retention, copy-number variation, and sequence conservation, we examined correlations with gene essentiality and functional traits. More than half of vertebrate, arthropod, and fungal orthologs are universally present across each lineage. These universal orthologs are preferentially distributed in groups with almost all single-copy or all multicopy genes, and sequence evolution of the predominantly single-copy orthologous groups is markedly more constrained. Essential genes from representative model organisms, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are significantly enriched in universal orthologs within each lineage, and essential-gene-containing groups consistently exhibit greater sequence conservation than those without. This study of eukaryotic gene repertoire evolution identifies shared fundamental principles and highlights lineage-specific features, it also confirms that essential genes are highly retained and conclusively supports the “knockout-rate prediction” of stronger constraints on essential gene sequence evolution. However, the distinction between sequence conservation of single- versus multicopy orthologs is quantitatively more prominent than between orthologous groups with and without essential genes. The previously underappreciated difference in the tolerance of gene duplications and contrasting evolutionary modes of “single-copy control” versus “multicopy license” may reflect a major evolutionary mechanism that allows extended exploration of gene sequence space.},

The other group retained the overall low GC content as well as the differential exon-intron GC content, and is associated with longer introns.

This group's exons also display higher nucleosome occupancy compared to flanking introns and exons of the other group, thus “marking” them for spliceosomal recognition.

	abstract = {The highly conserved translational control protein Dhh1 promotes mRNA decapping by regulating a late step in translation in yeast., Translational control and messenger RNA (mRNA) decay represent important control points in the regulation of gene expression. In yeast, the major pathway for mRNA decay is initiated by deadenylation followed by decapping and 5′–3′ exonucleolytic digestion of the mRNA. Proteins that activate decapping, such as the DEAD-box RNA helicase Dhh1, have been postulated to function by limiting translation initiation, thereby promoting a ribosome-free mRNA that is targeted for decapping. In contrast to this model, we show here that Dhh1 represses translation in vivo at a step subsequent to initiation. First, we establish that Dhh1 represses translation independent of initiation factors eIF4E and eIF3b. Second, we show association of Dhh1 on an mRNA leads to the accumulation of ribosomes on the transcript. Third, we demonstrate that endogenous Dhh1 accompanies slowly translocating polyribosomes. Lastly, Dhh1 activates decapping in response to impaired ribosome elongation. Together, these findings suggest that changes in ribosome transit rate represent a key event in the decapping and turnover of mRNA., Translation of mRNA into protein and turnover of mRNA are two points at which cells can exert regulatory control of gene expression, thereby ensuring that the protein products are present in cells and tissues at the appropriate time and place. The DDX6 family of DEAD box helicases, exemplified by the yeast protein Dhh1, is a group of well-conserved eukaryotic proteins that regulate translation and mRNA decay. As DDX6 proteins are known to be important for diverse processes such as cellular stress responses, early embryonic development, and replication of some viruses, understanding their mechanism of action could be of broad significance to many fields. Previous studies suggest that Dhh1 and other DDX6-family proteins mainly regulate translation at the initiation stage, triggering sequestration and/or decapping of the mRNA. Our work expands the potential functions of Dhh1, showing that Dhh1 is also capable of inhibiting translation at later stages when ribosomes are already loaded onto mRNAs. This extended function for Dhh1 allows a more robust translational control, as inhibition at a late stage of translation can provide immediate stoppage of protein production, as well as affording the potential for storing mRNA already primed and loaded with ribosomes for subsequent rapid re-utilization.},

At the P-site, proline is slow in forming peptide bonds.

Here we establish that the DEAD-box protein Dhh1p is a sensor of codon optimality that targets an mRNA for decay. First, we find mRNAs whose translation elongation rate is slowed by inclusion of nonoptimal codons are specifically degraded in a Dhh1p-dependent manner. Biochemical experiments show Dhh1p is preferentially associated with mRNAs with suboptimal codon choice. We find these effects on mRNA decay are sensitive to the number of slow moving ribosomes on an mRNA. Moreover, we find Dhh1p overexpression leads to the accumulation of ribosomes specifically on mRNAs (and even codons) of low codon optimality. Lastly, Dhh1p physically interacts with ribosomes in vivo. Together, these data argue that Dhh1p is a sensor for ribosome speed, targeting an mRNA for repression and subsequent decay.,},

In this study, we perform a novel analysis of the ribosome profiling data of four organisms which enables ranking the decoding times of different codons while filtering translational phenomena such as experimental biases, extreme ribosomal pauses and ribosome traffic jams. Based on this filtering, we show for the first time that there is a significant correlation between tRNA concentrations and the codons estimated decoding time both in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes in natural conditions (−0.38 to −0.66, all P values {\textless}0.006); in addition, we show that when considering tRNA concentrations, codons decoding times are not correlated with aminoacyl-tRNA levels. The reported results support the conjecture that translation efficiency is directly influenced by the tRNA levels in the cell. Thus, they should help to understand the evolution of synonymous aspects of coding sequences via the adaptation of their codons to the tRNA pool.},

	abstract = {Codon bias has been implicated as one of the major factors contributing to mRNA stability in several model organisms. However, the molecular mechanisms of codon bias on mRNA stability remain unclear in humans. Here, we show that human cells possess a mechanism to modulate RNA stability through a unique codon bias. Bioinformatics analysis showed that codons could be clustered into two distinct groups—codons with G or C at the third base position (GC3) and codons with either A or T at the third base position (AT3): the former stabilizing while the latter destabilizing mRNA. Quantification of codon bias showed that increased GC3‐content entails proportionately higher GC‐content. Through bioinformatics, ribosome profiling, and in vitro analysis, we show that decoupling the effects of codon bias reveals two modes of mRNA regulation, one GC3‐ and one GC‐content dependent. Employing an immunoprecipitation‐based strategy, we identify ILF2 and ILF3 as RNA‐binding proteins that differentially regulate global mRNA abundances based on codon bias. Our results demonstrate that codon bias is a two‐pronged system that governs mRNA abundance.},

Valid across a broad range of parameters, their use for understanding the adaptive dynamics of small selfing populations undergoing strong selection intensity (thereafter High Drift-High selection regime, HDHS) remains to be explored. Saclay Divergent Selection Experiments (DSEs) on maize flowering time provide an interesting example of populations evolving under HDHS, with significant selection responses over 20 generations in two directions. We combined experimental data from Saclay DSEs, forward individual-based simulations, and theoretical predictions to dissect the evolutionary mechanisms at play in the observed selection responses. We asked two main questions: How do mutations arise, spread, and reach fixation in populations evolving under HDHS? How does the interplay between drift and selection influence observed phenotypic shifts? We showed that the long-lasting response to selection in small populations is due to the rapid fixation of mutations occurring during the generations of selection. Among fixed mutations, we also found a clear signal of enrichment for beneficial mutations revealing a limited cost of selection. Both environmental stochasticity and variation in selection coefficients likely contributed to exacerbate mutational effects, thereby facilitating selection grasp and fixation of small-effect mutations. Together our results highlight that despite a small number of polymorphic loci expected under HDHS, adaptive variation is continuously fueled by a vast mutational target. We discuss our results in the context of breeding and long-term survival of small selfing populations.},

This provides direct evidence for selection on silent sites in those three distantly related multicellular eukaryotes. Surprisingly, there is a strong negative correlation between codon usage and protein length. This effect is not due to a smaller size of highly expressed proteins. Thus, for a same-expression pattern, the selective pressure on codon usage appears to be lower in genes encoding long rather than short proteins. This puzzling observation is not predicted by any of the current models of selection on codon usage and thus raises the question of how translation efficiency affects fitness in multicellular organisms.},

In general, studies of codon usage bias (CUB) assume that codons with higher tRNA abundance have lower missense error rates. Using a model of protein translation based on tRNA competition and intra-ribosomal kinetics, we show that this assumption can be violated when tRNA abundances are positively correlated across the genetic code. Examining the distribution of tRNA abundances across 73 bacterial genomes from 20 different genera, we find a consistent positive correlation between tRNA abundances across the genetic code. This work challenges one of the fundamental assumptions made in over 30 years of research on CUB that codons with higher tRNA abundances have lower missense error rates and that missense errors are the primary selective force responsible for CUB., Codon usage bias (CUB) is a ubiquitous and important phenomenon. CUB is thought to be driven primarily due to selection against missense errors. For over 30 years, the standard model of translation errors has implicitly assumed that the relationship between translation errors and tRNA abundances are inversely related. This is based on an implicit and unstated assumption that the distribution of tRNA abundances across the genetic code are uncorrelated. Examining these abundance distributions across 73 bacterial genomes from 20 different genera, we find a consistent positive correlation between tRNA abundances across the genetic code. We further show that codons with higher tRNA abundances are not always “optimal” with respect to reducing the missense error rate and hence cannot explain the observed patterns of CUB.},

In this paper, a detailed analysis provides arguments that this phenomenon, at least for the proteins under study, is not related to aspects of messenger RNA such as secondary structure. It is linked to the difference in transfer RNA availability for the various codons. Experimental analysis of translation of other proteins in E. coli confirms that the main origin for the discontinuous translation in the polypeptide elongation cycle is the following. For a given codon, the stochastic search of the cognate ternary complex (aminoacyl-tRNA-EF-Tu-GTP) is the rate-limiting step in the elongation cycle: transpeptidation and translocation steps are much faster. The degree of slackening in ribosome movement is almost proportional to the inverse of tRNA concentrations. The verification of this model and its possible physiological significance are discussed.},

This suggests that fast-growers are adapted for fast protein synthesis. There is also considerable evidence that codon usage is influenced by accuracy of translation, and some authors have argued that accuracy is more important than speed. Here we compare the strength of the two effects by studying the codon usages in high and low expression genes and on conserved and variable sites within high expression genes. We introduce a simple statistical method that can be used to assess the significance and the strength of the two types of bias in the same sets of sequences. We compare our statistical measure of codon bias to the common used codon adaptation index, and show that the new measure is preferable for three reasons for the purposes of this analysis. Across a large sample of bacterial genomes, both effects from speed and accuracy are clearly visible, although the speed effect appears to be much stronger than the accuracy effect and is found to be significant in a larger proportion of genomes. It is also difficult to explain the correlation of codon bias in the high expression genes with growth rates and numbers of copies of tRNA and rRNA genes on the basis of selection for accuracy. Hence we conclude that selection for translational speed is a dominant effect in driving codon usage bias in fast-growing bacteria, with selection for accuracy playing a small supplementary role.},

In this study, we analyse the speed and accuracy of the decoding step under conditions reproducing the high speed of translation in vivo. We show that error frequency is close to 10⁻³, consistent with the values measured in vivo. Selectivity is predominantly due to the differences in k(cat) values for cognate and near-cognate reactions, whereas the intrinsic affinity differences are not used for tRNA discrimination. Thus, the ribosome seems to be optimized towards high speed of translation at the cost of fidelity. Competition with near- and non-cognate ternary complexes reduces the rate of GTP hydrolysis in the cognate ternary complex, but does not appreciably affect the rate-limiting tRNA accommodation step. The GTP hydrolysis step is crucial for the optimization of both the speed and accuracy, which explains the necessity for the trade-off between the two fundamental parameters of translation.},

Because most studies have focused only on codon usage, we analyzed the tRNA gene pool of 102 bacterial species. We show that as minimal generation times get shorter, the genomes contain more tRNA genes, but fewer anticodon species. Surprisingly, despite the wide G+C variation of bacterial genomes these anticodons are the same in most genomes. This suggests an optimization of the translation machinery to use a small subset of optimal codons and anticodons in fast-growing bacteria and in highly expressed genes. As a result, the overrepresented codons in highly expressed genes tend to be the same in very different genomes to match the same most-frequent anticodons. This is particularly important in fast-growing bacteria, which have higher codon usage bias in these genes. Three models were tested to understand the choice of codons recognized by the same anticodons, all providing significant fit, but under different classes of genes and genomes. Thus, co-evolution of tRNA gene composition and codon usage bias in genomes seen from tRNA's point of view agrees with the selection-mutation-drift theory. However, it suggests a much more universal trend in the evolution of anticodon and codon choice than previously thought. It also provides new evidence that a selective force for the optimization of the translation machinery is the maximization of growth.},

Originally tailored to codon sequences of distantly related lineages, dN/dS represents the ratio of fixed nonsynonymous to synonymous differences. The impact of ancestral and lineage-specific polymorphisms on dN/dS, which we here show to be substantial for closely related lineages, is generally neglected in estimation techniques of dN/dS. To address this issue, we formulate a codon model that is firmly anchored in population genetic theory, derive analytical expressions for the dN/dS measure by Poisson random field approximation in a Markovian framework and validate the derivations by simulations. In good agreement, simulations and analytical derivations demonstrate that dN/dS is biased by polymorphisms at short time scales and that it can take substantial time for the expected value to settle at its time limit where only fixed differences are considered. We further show that in any attempt to estimate the dN/dS ratio from empirical data the effect of the intrinsic fluctuations of a ratio of stochastic variables, can even under neutrality yield extreme values of dN/dS at short time scales or in regions of low mutation rate. Taken together, our results have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS estimates, the McDonald–Kreitman test and other related statistics, in particular for closely related lineages.},

	abstract = {Whether codon usage fine-tunes mRNA translation in mammals remains controversial, with recent papers suggesting that production of proteins in specific Gene Ontological (GO) pathways can be regulated by actively modifying the codon and anticodon pools in different cellular conditions. In this work, we compared the sequence content of genes in specific GO categories with the exonic genome background. Although a substantial fraction of variability in codon usage could be explained by random sampling, almost half of GO sets showed more variability in codon usage than expected by chance. Nevertheless, by quantifying translational efficiency in healthy and cancerous tissues in human and mouse, we demonstrated that a given tRNA pool can equally well translate many different sets of mRNAs, irrespective of their cell-type specificity. This disconnect between variations in codon usage and the stability of translational efficiency is best explained by differences in GC content between gene sets. GC variation across the mammalian genome is most likely a result of the interplay between genome repair and gene duplication mechanisms, rather than selective pressures caused by codon-driven translational rates. Consequently, codon usage differences in mammalian transcriptomes are most easily explained by well-understood mutational biases acting on the underlying genome.},

Here, we characterized the expression of mRNA and tRNA genes quantitatively at multiple time points in two developing mouse tissues. We discovered that mRNA codon pools are highly stable over development and simply reflect the genomic background; in contrast, precise regulation of tRNA gene families is required to create the corresponding tRNA transcriptomes. The dynamic regulation of tRNA genes during development is controlled in order to generate an anticodon pool that closely corresponds to messenger RNAs. Thus, across development, the pools of mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons are invariant and highly correlated, revealing a stable molecular interaction interlocking transcription and translation.},

Here, we have shown that the correlations (iii, a and b) for ‘localized genes’ and genes from the bank are in full agreement, indicating that the former set is representative of the latter. We haven then used the data (i) and the correlation (ii) to estimate the distribution of genes in isochore families. We have found that 34 \% of the genes are located in the GC-poor isochores (which represent 62\% of the genome), 38\% in the GC-rich isochores (31 Y0of the genome) and 28\% in the GC-richest isochores (3\% of the genome). There is, therefore, a compositional gradient of gene concentration in the human genome. The gene density in the GC-richest 3 \% of the genome is about eight times higher than in the GC-rich 3 1\%) and about 16 times higher than in the GC-poorest 62\%.},

	abstract = {The compositional distributions of coding sequences and DNA molecules (in the 50100-kb range) are remarkably narrower in murids (rat and mouse) compared to humans (as well as to all other mammals explored so far). In murids, both distributions begin at higher and end at lower GC values. A comparison of homologous coding sequences from murids and humans revealed that their different compositional distributions are due to differences in GC levels in all three codon positions, particularly of genes located at both ends of the distribution. In turn, these differences are responsible for differences in both codon usage and amino acids. When GC levels at first + second codon positions and third codon positions, respectively, of murid genes are plotted against corresponding GC levels of homologous human genes, linear relationships (with very high correlation coefficients and slopes of about 0.78 and 0.60, respectively) are found. This indicates a conservation of the order of GC levels in homologous genes from humans and murids. (The same comparison for mouse and rat genes indicates a conservation of GC levels of homologous genes.) A similar linear relationship was observed When plotting GC levels of corresponding DNA fractions (as obtained by density gradient centrifugation in the presence of a sequence-specific ligand) from mouse and human. These findings indicate that orderly compositional changes affectingnot only coding sequences but also noncoding sequences took place since the divergence of murids. Such directional fixations of mutations point to the existence ofselective pressures affectingthe genome as a whole.},

It is one of the most subtle and pervasive forces of molecular evolution, yet, establishing the underlying causes for its idiosyncratic behaviour across living kingdoms has proven elusive to researchers over the past 20 years. In this study, a statistical model for measuring translational selection in any given genome is developed, and the test is applied to 126 fully sequenced genomes, ranging from archaea to eukaryotes. It is shown that tRNA gene redundancy and genome size are interacting forces that ultimately determine the action of translational selection, and that an optimal genome size exists for which this kind of selection is maximal. Accordingly, genome size also presents upper and lower boundaries beyond which selection on codon usage is not possible. We propose a model where the coevolution of genome size and tRNA genes explains the observed patterns in translational selection in all living organisms. This model finally unifies our understanding of codon usage across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Helicobacter pylori, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens are codon usage paradigms that can be better understood under the proposed model.},

A population genetic model is developed taking into account population size and selective differences between synonymous codons. A biochemical model is then developed to predict the magnitude of selective differences between synonymous codons in unicellular organisms in which growth rate (or possibly growth yield) can be equated with fitness. Selection can arise from differences in either the speed or the accuracy of translation. A model for the effect of speed of translation on fitness is considered in detail, a similar model for accuracy more briefly. The model is successful in predicting a difference in the degree of bias at the beginning than in the rest of the gene under some circumstances, as observed in Escherichia coli, but grossly overestimates the amount of bias expected. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.},

Highly expressed genes, such as those encoding ribosomal proteins and histones in S. pombe, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster, have biased patterns of codon usage which have been observed in a wide range of unicellular organisms. In S. pombe and C. elegans, codons contributing positively to the principal component with the largest variance (Z1-parameter) corresponded to the optimal codons which were predicted on the basis of tRNA gene numbers. In D. melanogaster, this correlation was less evident, and the codons contributing positively to the Z1-parameter corresponded primarily to codons with a C or G in the codon third position. In X. laevis and H. sapiens, codon usage in the genes encoding ribosomal proteins and histones was not significantly biased, suggesting that the primary factor influencing codon-usage diversity in these species is not translation efficiency.

However, the efficiencies of the different codon–tRNA interactions are expected to vary among different organisms. In this study, we suggest a new approach for adjusting the tAI weights to any target model organism without the need for gene expression measurements. Our method is based on optimizing the correlation between the tAI and a measure of codon usage bias. Here, we show that in non-fungal the new tAI weights predict protein abundance significantly better than the traditional tAI weights. The unique tRNA–codon adaptation weights computed for 100 different organisms exhibit a significant correlation with evolutionary distance. The reported results demonstrate the usefulness of the new measure in future genomic studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of the human genome has revealed that as much as an order of magnitude more of the genomic sequence is transcribed than accounted for by the predicted and characterized genes. A number of these transcripts are alternatively spliced forms of known protein coding genes; however, it is becoming clear that many of them do not necessarily correspond to a functional protein.
RESULTS: In this study we analyze alternative splicing isoforms of human gene products that are unambiguously identified by mass spectrometry and compare their properties with those of isoforms of the same genes for which no peptide was found in publicly available mass spectrometry datasets. We analyze them in detail for the presence of uninterrupted functional domains, active sites as well as the plausibility of their predicted structure. We report how well each of these strategies and their combination can correctly identify translated isoforms and derive a lower limit for their specificity, that is, their ability to correctly identify non-translated products.
CONCLUSIONS: The most effective strategy for correctly identifying translated products relies on the conservation of active sites, but it can only be applied to a small fraction of isoforms, while a reasonably high coverage, sensitivity and specificity can be achieved by analyzing the presence of non-truncated functional domains. Combining the latter with an assessment of the plausibility of the modeled structure of the isoform increases both coverage and specificity with a moderate cost in terms of sensitivity.},

	abstract = {THE relationship between abundance and body size is the subject of considerable debate in ecology1–15. Several data sets spanning a large range of body sizes show linear negative relationships between abundance and weight l–6 when these are measured on a logarithmic scale. But other studies of the abundances of species from single taxa, such as birds, which span a narrower range of body sizes reveal either little or no relationship, or a triangular relationship 9–15. Errors in estimating abundance might obscure relationships that do exist over a narrow range of body sizes. We describe here the relationship between body weight and abundance in British birds, whose population size estimates are unusually good. Abundance across all species declines with a −0.75 power of body weight, which conforms with the energetic equivalence 'rule'2,16. There is, however, a significant positive relationship between abundance and body weight within lower taxa. Those tribes that do not share recent common ancestry with other British birds are most likely to show a positive relationship across their constituent species. We thus show that phylogenetic relatedness might be an important indicator of the structure of the relationship between body size and abundance.},

	abstract = {Body size is perhaps the most fundamental property of an organism and is related to many biological traits, including abundance. The relationship between abundance and body size has been extensively studied in an attempt to quantify the form of the relationship and to understand the processes that generate it. However, progress has been impeded by the underappreciated fact that there are four distinct, but interrelated, relationships between size and abundance that are often confused in the literature. Here, we review and distinguish between these four patterns, and discuss the linkages between them. We argue that a synthetic understanding of size–abundance relationships will result from more detailed analyses of individual patterns and from careful consideration of how and why the patterns are related.},

	abstract = {Genetic robustness is defined as the constancy of a phenotype in the face of deleterious mutations. Overexpression of chaperones, to assist the folding of proteins carrying deleterious mutations, is so far one of the most accepted molecular mechanisms enhancing genetic robustness. Most theories on the evolution of robustness have focused on the implications of high mutation rate. Here we show that genetic drift, which is modulated by population size, organism complexity, and epistasis, can be a sufficient force to select for chaperone-mediated genetic robustness. Using an exact analytical solution, we also show that selection for costly genetic robustness leads to a paradox: the decrease of population fitness on long timescales and the long-term dependency on robustness mechanisms. We suggest that selection for genetic robustness could be universal and not restricted to high mutation rate organisms such as RNA viruses. The evolution of the endosymbiont Buchnera illustrates this selection mechanism and its paradox: the increased dependency on chaperones mediating genetic robustness. Our model explains why most chaperones might have become essential even in optimal growth conditions.},

Although APA is commonly believed to generate beneficial functional diversity and be adaptive, we hypothesize that most genes have one optimal polyadenylation site and that APA is caused largely by deleterious polyadenylation errors. The error hypothesis, but not the adaptive hypothesis, predicts that, as the expression level of a gene rises, its polyadenylation diversity declines, relative use of the major (presumably optimal) polyadenylation site increases, and that of each minor (presumably nonoptimal) site decreases. It further predicts that the number of polyadenylation signals per gene is smaller than the random expectation and that polyadenylation signals for major but not minor sites are under purifying selection. All of these predictions are confirmed in mammals, suggesting that numerous defective RNAs are produced in normal cells, many phenotypic variations at the molecular level are nonadaptive, and that cellular life is noisier than is appreciated.},

Evolutionary and structural homology are not the same and sequence alignments generated with methods designed for structural matching can be seriously misleading in comparative and phylogenetic analyses.

Unlike other alignment programs, prank makes use of phylogenetic information to distinguish alignment gaps caused by insertions or deletions and, thereafter, handles the two types of events differently. As a by-product of the correct handling of insertions and deletions, prank can provide the inferred ancestral sequences as a part of the output and mark the alignment gaps differently depending on their origin in insertion or deletion events. As the algorithm infers the evolutionary history of the sequences, prank can be sensitive to errors in the guide phylogeny and violations on the underlying assumptions about the origin and patterns of gaps.

	abstract = {The Encyclopedia of Life (EOL, http://eol.org) aims to provide unprecedented global access to a broad range of information about life on Earth. It currently contains 3.5 million distinct pages for taxa and provides content for 1.3 million of those pages. The content is primarily contributed by EOL content partners (providers) that have a more limited geographic, taxonomic or topical scope. EOL aggregates these data and automatically integrates them based on associated scientific names and other classification information. EOL also provides interfaces for curation and direct content addition. All materials in EOL are either in the public domain or licensed under a Creative Commons license. In addition to the web interface, EOL is also accessible through an Application Programming Interface.
In this paper, we review recent developments added for Version 2 of the web site and subsequent releases through Version 2.2, which have made EOL more engaging, personal, accessible and internationalizable. We outline the core features and technical architecture of the system. We summarize milestones achieved so far by EOL to present results of the current system implementation and establish benchmarks upon which to judge future improvements.
We have shown that it is possible to successfully integrate large amounts of descriptive biodiversity data from diverse sources into a robust, standards-based, dynamic, and scalable infrastructure. Increasing global participation and the emergence of EOL-powered applications demonstrate that EOL is becoming a significant resource for anyone interested in biological diversity.},

	abstract = {The introduction of DNA analysis to forensic science brought with it a number of choices for analysis, not all of which were compatible. As laboratories throughout Europe were eager to use the new technology different systems became routine in different laboratories and consequently, there was no basis for the exchange of results. A period of co-operation then started in which a nucleus of forensic scientists agreed on an uniform system. This collaboration spread to incorporate most of the established forensic science laboratories in Europe and continued through two major changes in the technology. At each step agreement was reached on which systems to use. From the beginning it was realised that DNA databases would provide the criminal justice systems with an efficient way of crime solving and consequently some local databases were created. It was not until the introduction of the amplification technology linked to the analysis of short tandem repeats that a sufficiently sensitive and robust system was available for the formation of efficient and effective DNA databases. Comprehensive legislation enacted in the UK in 1995 enabled forensic scientists to set up the first national DNA database which would hold both personal DNA profiles together with results obtained from crime scenes. Other countries quickly followed but in some the legislation has severely restricted the amount and type of data which can be retained and, therefore, effectiveness of the databases is limited. The widespread use of commercially produced multiplex kits has produced a situation in which nearly all European laboratories are using compatible systems and there is, therefore, the potential for the introduction of a pan-European DNA database. However, the exchange of results between countries is hampered by the various legislations which currently exist.},

Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straight-forward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

Because of the algorithm's efficiency on many microcomputers, sensitive protein database searches may now become a routine procedure for molecular biologists. The method efficiently identifies regions of similar sequence and then scores the aligned identical and differing residues in those regions by means of an amino acid replaceability matrix. This matrix increases sensitivity by giving high scores to those amino acid replacements which occur frequently in evolution. The algorithm has been implemented in a computer program designed to search protein databases very rapidly. For example, comparison of a 200-amino-acid sequence to the 500,000 residues in the National Biomedical Research Foundation library would take less than 2 minutes on a minicomputer, and less than 10 minutes on a microcomputer (IBM PC).},

The subsequent development of the third-generation sequencing technologies represented by nanopore and zero-mode waveguide techniques offers even higher speed and long read length with promising applications in portable and rapid genomic tests in field. Especially under the current circumstances, issues such as public health emergencies and global pandemics impose soaring demand on quick identification of origins and species of analytes through DNA sequences. In addition, future development of disease diagnosis, treatment, and tracking techniques may also require frequent DNA testing. As a result, DNA sequencers with miniaturized size and highly integrated components for personal and portable use to tackle increasing needs for disease prevention, personal medicine, and biohazard protection may become future trends. Just like many other biological and medical analytical systems that were originally bulky in sizes, collaborative work from various subjects in engineering and science eventually leads to the miniaturization of these systems. DNA sequencers that involve nanoprobes, detectors, microfluidics, microelectronics, and circuits as well as complex functional materials and structures are extremely complicated but may be miniaturized with technical advancement. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art technology in developing essential components in DNA sequencers and analyzes the feasibility to achieve miniaturized DNA sequencers for personal use. Future perspectives on the opportunities and associated challenges for compact DNA sequencers are also identified.},

Incremental improvements allowed sequencing of molecules \&gt;200 kb (human cytomegalovirus) leading to an avalanche of data that demanded computational analysis and spawned the field of bioinformatics. The US Human Genome Project spurred sequencing activity. By 1992 the first ‘sequencing factory’ was established, and others soon followed. The first complete cellular genome sequences, from bacteria, appeared in 1995 and other eubacterial, archaebacterial and eukaryotic genomes were soon sequenced. Competition between the public Human Genome Project and Celera Genomics produced working drafts of the human genome sequence, published in 2001, but refinement and analysis of the human genome sequence will continue for the foreseeable future. New ‘massively parallel’ sequencing methods are greatly increasing sequencing capacity, but further innovations are needed to achieve the ‘thousand dollar genome’ that many feel is prerequisite to personalized genomic medicine. These advances will also allow new approaches to a variety of problems in biology, evolution and the environment.},

	abstract = {The Human Genome Project has become a reality. Building on a debate that dates back to 1985, several genome projects are now in full stride around the world, and more are likely to form in the next several years. Italy began its genome program in 1987, and the United Kingdom and U.S.S.R in 1988. The European communities mounted several genome projects on yeast, bacteria, Drosophila, and Arabidospis thaliana (a rapidly growing plant with a small genome) in 1988, and in 1990 commenced a new 2-year program on the human genome. In the United States, we have completed the first year of operation of the National Center for Human Genome Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), now the largest single funding source for genome research in the world. There have been dedicated budgets focused on genome-scale research at NIH, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for several years, and results are beginning to accumulate. There were three annual meetings on genome mapping and sequencing at Cold Spring Harbor, New York, in the spring of 1988, 1989, and 1990; the talks have shifted from a discussion about how to approach problems to presenting results from experiments already performed. We have finally begun to work rather than merely talk. The purpose of genome projects is to assemble data on the structure of DNA in human chromosomes and those of other organisms. A second goal is to develop new technologies to perform mapping and sequencing. There have been impressive technical advances in the past 5 years since the debate about the human genome project began. We are on the verge of beginning pilot projects to test several approaches to sequencing long stretches of DNA, using both automation and manual methods. Ordered sets of yeast artificial chromosome and cosmid clones have been assembled to span more than 2 million base pairs of several human chromosomes, and a region of 10 million base pairs has been assembled for Caenorhabditis elegans by a collaboration between Washington University and the Medical Research Council laboratory in Cambridge, U.K. This project is now turning to sequencing C. elegans DNA as a logical extension of this work.

	abstract = {The proposal that all mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) types in contemporary humans stem from a common ancestor present in an African population some 200,000 years ago has attracted much attention. To study this proposal further, two hypervariable segments of mtDNA were sequenced from 189 people of diverse geographic origin, including 121 native Africans. Geographic specificity was observed in that identical mtDNA types are shared within but not between populations. A tree relating these mtDNA sequences to one another and to a chimpanzee sequence has many deep branches leading exclusively to African mtDNAs. An African origin for human mtDNA is supported by two statistical tests. With the use of the chimpanzee and human sequences to calibrate the rate of mtDNA evolution, the age of the common human mtDNA ancestor is placed between 166,000 and 249,000 years. These results thus support and extend the African origin hypothesis of human mtDNA evolution.},

We develop a likelihood-free, simulation-based approach, which combines deep learning with (1) a large set of summary statistics measured on phylogenies or (2) a complete and compact representation of trees, which avoids potential limitations of summary statistics and applies to any phylodynamics model. Our method enables both model selection and estimation of epidemiological parameters from very large phylogenies. We demonstrate its speed and accuracy on simulated data, where it performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. To illustrate its applicability, we assess the dynamics induced by superspreading individuals in an HIV dataset of men-having-sex-with-men in Zurich.

This operation has elicited considerable interest due to its significant influence on various critical aspects of life (e.g., identifying mutations in coronaviruses). Sequence alignment over large databases cannot yield results within a reasonable time, power, and cost. heuristic methods, such as FASTA, the BLAST family have been demonstrated to perform 40 times faster than DP-based (e.g., Needleman-Wunsch) techniques they cannot guarantee an optimum alignment result An optimized software platform of a widely used DNA sequence alignment algorithm called the Needleman-Wunsch (NW) algorithm based on a lookup table, is described in this study. This global alignment algorithm is the best approach for identifying similar regions between sequences. This study presents a new application of classical machine learning (ML) to global sequence alignment. Customized ML models are used to implement NW global alignment. An accuracy of 99.7\% is achieved when using a multilayer perceptron with the ADAM optimizer, and up to 2912 Giga cell updates per second are realized on two real DNA sequences with a length of 4.1 M nucleotides.

	abstract = {Sequence alignment is an essential component of bioinformatics, for identifying regions of similarity that may indicate functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences. Genome-based diagnostics relying on DNA sequencing have benefited hugely from the boom in computing power in recent decades, particularly due to cloud-computing and the rise of graphics processing units (GPUs) and other advanced computing platforms for running advanced algorithms. Translating the success of such breakthroughs in diagnostics to affordable solutions for low-cost healthcare requires development of algorithms that can operate on the edge instead of in the cloud, using low-cost and low-power electronic systems such as microcontrollers and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In this work, we present EdgeAlign, a deep reinforcement learning based method for performing pairwise DNA sequence alignment on stand-alone edge devices. EdgeAlign uses deep reinforcement learning to train a deep Q-network (DQN) agent for performing sequence alignment on fixed length sub-sequences, using a sliding window that is scanned over the length of the entire sequence. The hardware resource-consumption for implementing this scheme is thus independent of the lengths of the sequences to be aligned, and is further optimized using a novel AutoML based method for neural network model size reduction. Unlike other algorithms for sequence alignment reported in literature, the model demonstrated in this work is highly compact and deployed on two edge devices (NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit and Digilent Arty A7-100T, containing Xilinx XC7A35T Artix-7 FPGA) for demonstration of alignment for sequences from the publicly available Influenza sequences at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Virus Data Hub.},

	abstract = {A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

	abstract = {Alignments are a powerful way to compare related DNA or protein sequences. They can be used to capture various facts about the sequences aligned, such as common evolutionary descent or common structural function. We take the general view that the alignment of letters from two or multiple sequences represents the hypothesis that they are descended from a common ancestral sequence. DNA molecules are composed of chains of nucleotides, and protein molecules are composed of chains of amino acids. The specific order of nucleotides or amino acids within these chains are respectively called DNA and protein sequences. Perhaps chief among the various biological functions of DNA sequences is to encode protein sequences, because proteins are involved in most of the biological functions of living cells. DNA sequences, and the protein sequences they encode, evolve by mutation followed by natural selection. There are a variety of mechanisms for DNA mutation, but the most common result is the substitution of a single nucleotide for another, or the deletion or insertion of one or several adjacent nucleotides. At the protein level, the most common resulting mutations are the substitution of one amino acid for another, or the insertion or deletion of one or multiple adjacent amino acids. There is no simple biological mechanism for exchanging the order of two letters in a DNA or protein sequence, so an alignment representing the common descent of two DNA or protein sequences is co-linear, with no “crossovers” between corresponding letters.},

This paper analyses that story, discussing the origins of the informational view of our genes during the early 1950s, how such a view affected the research on the genetic code (1950s and ‘60s) and the transformation of the information idea in the context of DNA sequencing and bioinformatics (‘80s and ‘90s). I suggest that the concept of DNA as information reached a climax with the proposal of the Human Genome Project (HGP), but is currently facing a crisis coinciding with the questioning of the information society. Finally, I discuss the emergence of systems biology as an alternative paradigm.},

Ledley, who produced the ﬁrst computer-based collection of protein sequences, published in book format in 1965 as the Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. While these practices are generally associated with the rise of molecular evolution in the 1960s, this paper shows that they grew out of research agendas from the previous decade, including the biochemical investigation of the relations between the structures and function of proteins and the theoretical attempt to decipher the genetic code. It also shows how computers became essential for the handling and analysis of sequence data. Finally, this paper reﬂects on the relationships between experimenting and collecting as two distinct ‘‘ways of knowing’’ that were essential for the transformation of the life sciences in the twentieth century.},

Recombinant DNA has had an enormous impact on our understanding of the molecular basis of cell biology by allowing the isolation and sequencing of a wide variety of important genes. Until the last few years, scientists had generally focused on the cloning, sequencing, and further characterization of specific genes. Now, however, recombinant DNA technology allows the alternative approach of cloning and sequencing entire genomes. In principle, this approach has the potential of identifying all the genes in an organism, which then become accessible for investigations of their structure and function. Genome sequencing is thus providing scientists with a unique database, consisting of the nucleotide sequences of complete sets of genes. Since many of these genes have not been previously identified, determination of their functions will form the basis of many future studies in cell biology.},

Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers ∼99\% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of ∼1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000–25,000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead.},

We argue that many of these modifications emerged passively in response to the long-term population-size reductions that accompanied increases in organism size. According to this model, much of the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes was initiated by nonadaptive processes, and this in turn provided novel substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic complexity by natural selection. The enormous long-term effective population sizes of prokaryotes may impose a substantial barrier to the evolution of complex genomes and morphologies.},

Darwin, in short, desperately needed Mendel. In this paper, we set Mendel’s work in the context of experimental biology and animal/plant breeding of the period and review both the well-known story of possible contact between Mendel and Darwin and the actual contact between their ideas after their deaths. Mendel’s contributions to evolutionary biology were fortuitous. Regardless, it is Mendel’s work that completed Darwin’s theory.

	doi = {10.1093/jhered/esac023},
	abstract = {Few doubt that effective population size (Ne) is one of the most important parameters in evolutionary biology, but how many can say they really understand the concept? Ne is the evolutionary analog of the number of individuals (or adults) in the population, N. Whereas ecological consequences of population size depend on N, evolutionary consequences (rates of loss of genetic diversity and increase in inbreeding; relative effectiveness of selection) depend on Ne. Formal definitions typically relate effective size to a key population genetic parameter, such as loss of heterozygosity or variance in allele frequency. However, for practical application to real populations, it is more useful to define Ne in terms of 3 demographic parameters: number of potential parents (adult N), and mean and variance in offspring number. Defined this way, Ne determines the rate of random genetic drift across the entire genome in the offspring generation. Other evolutionary forces (mutation, migration, selection)-together with factors such as variation in recombination rate-can also affect genetic variation, and this leads to heterogeneity across the genome in observed rates of genetic change. For some, it has been convenient to interpret this heterogeneity in terms of heterogeneity in Ne, but unfortunately, this has muddled the concepts of genetic drift and effective population size. A commonly repeated misconception is that Ne is the number of parents that actually contribute genes to the next generation (NP). In reality, NP can be smaller or larger than Ne, and the NP/Ne ratio depends on the sex ratio, the mean and variance in offspring number, and whether inbreeding or variance Ne is of interest.},

	abstract = {The effective size of a population, Ne, determines the rate of change in the composition of a population caused by genetic drift, which is the random sampling of genetic variants in a finite population. Ne is crucial in determining the level of variability in a population, and the effectiveness of selection relative to drift.There are three major ways by which the rate of genetic drift can be modelled in the simplest type of population: increase in variance of allele frequencies; approach to identity by descent of all alleles; and coalescence of a sample of alleles into an ancestral allele.A general method for calculating Ne has been developed using coalescent theory for populations in which there are several 'compartments' (for example, ages or sexes) in the population from which alleles can be sampled. This involves the fast timescale approximation, in which the flow of alleles between compartments is faster than the rate of coalescence.Formulae are presented for the effects on Ne of differences in numbers of breeding males and females, differences in variance of offspring number between males and females, levels of inbreeding, changes in population size and modes of inheritance.Methods for estimating Ne for natural and artificial populations are described, using both demographic and genetic approaches. Examples of the results of the application of these methods are presented.The theory of how selection operates in a finite population is outlined, based on the formula for the probabilities of fixation of favourable and deleterious mutations. These depend on the product of the selection coefficient and Ne.There are data that show that the level of molecular sequence adaptation is reduced when Ne is low, as predicted from the product of the selection coefficient and Ne.The problem of describing neutral variability and the outcome of selection in a spatially or genetically structured population is discussed. A great simplification occurs when there is a large number of local populations in a structured metapopulation.Selection at one or more sites in the genome can influence the value of Ne at other, genetically linked sites by several mechanisms. Balancing selection can elevate Ne, whereas positive selection and purifying selection reduce it.Data on molecular variation and evolution are described, which are consistent with these theoretical predictions.},

	doi = {10.1093/molbev/mss238},
	abstract = {The nearly-neutral theory of molecular evolution has been widely accepted as the guiding principle for understanding how selection affects gene sequence evolution. One of its central predictions is that the rate at which proteins evolve should negatively scale with effective population size (N(e)). In contrast to the expectation of reduced selective constraint in the mitochondrial genome following from its lower N(e), we observe what can be interpreted as the opposite: for a taxonomically diverse set of organisms (birds, mammals, insects, nematodes) mitochondrially encoded protein-coding genes from the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (mtOXPHOS; n=12-13) show markedly stronger signatures of purifying selection (illustrated by low d(N)/d(S)) than their nuclear counterparts interacting in the same pathway (nuOXPHOS; n{\textasciitilde}75). To understand these unexpected evolutionary dynamics, we consider a number of structural and functional parameters including gene expression, hydrophobicity, transmembrane position, gene-ontology, GC content, substitution rate, proportion of amino-acids in transmembrane helices and protein-protein interaction. Across all taxa, unexpectedly large differences in gene expression levels (RNA-seq) between nuclear and mitochondrially encoded genes, and to a lower extent hydrophobicity, explained most of the variation in d(N)/d(S). Similarly, differences in d(N)/d(S) between functional OXPHOS protein complexes could largely be explained by gene expression differences. Overall, by including gene expression and other functional parameters the unexpected mitochondrial evolutionary dynamics can be understood. Our results not only reaffirm the link between gene-expression and protein evolution, but also open new questions about the functional role of expression level variation between mitochondrial genes.},

Although the contribution of natural selection at the molecular level has been debated for over 30 years, the relevant data and appropriate statistical methods to address this issue have only begun to emerge. This paper will ﬁrst present the predominant models of neutral, nearly neutral, and adaptive molecular evolution. Then, a method to identify the role of natural selection in molecular evolution by comparing within- and between-species DNA sequence variation will be presented. Computer simulations show that such methods are powerful for detecting even very weak selection. Examination of DNA variation data within and between Drosophila species suggests that ‘silent’ sites evolve under a balance between weak selection and genetic drift. Simulated data also show that sequence comparisons are a powerful method to detect adaptive protein evolution, even when selection is weak or aﬀects a small fraction of nucleotide sites. In the Drosophila data examined, positive selection appears to be a predominant force in protein evolution. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, little is known about what determines its evolution, as most studies of mutation rates have focused on single species with different methodologies2. Here we quantify germline mutation rates across vertebrates by sequencing and comparing the high-coverage genomes of 151 parent–offspring trios from 68 species of mammals, fishes, birds and reptiles. We show that the per-generation mutation rate varies among species by a factor of 40, with mutation rates being higher for males than for females in mammals and birds, but not in reptiles and fishes. The generation time, age at maturity and species-level fecundity are the key life-history traits affecting this variation among species. Furthermore, species with higher long-term effective population sizes tend to have lower mutation rates per generation, providing support for the drift barrier hypothesis3. The exceptionally high yearly mutation rates of domesticated animals, which have been continually selected on fecundity traits including shorter generation times, further support the importance of generation time in the evolution of mutation rates. Overall, our comparative analysis of pedigree-based mutation rates provides ecological insights on the mutation rate evolution in vertebrates.},

These sources vary in their frequencies and resultant mutations, and are differently affected by the DNA sequence, DNA transactions, and cellular metabolism. Organisms possess a variety of cellular functions to suppress spontaneous mutagenesis, and the specificity and effectiveness of each function strongly affect the pattern of spontaneous mutations. Base substitutions and single-base frameshifts, two major classes of spontaneous mutations, occur non-randomly throughout the genome. Within target DNA sequences there are hotspots for particular types of spontaneous mutations; outside of the hotspots, spontaneous mutations occur more randomly and much less frequently. Hotspot mutations are attributable more to endogenous DNA lesions than to replication errors. Recently, a novel class of mutagenic pathway that depends on short inverted repeats was identified as another important source of hotspot mutagenesis.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary origin of the striking genome size variations found in eukaryotes remains enigmatic. The effective size of populations, by controlling selection efficacy, is expected to be a key parameter underlying genome size evolution. However, this hypothesis has proved difficult to investigate using empirical data sets. Here, we tested this hypothesis using 22 de novo transcriptomes and low-coverage genomes of asellid isopods, which represent 11 independent habitat shifts from surface water to resource-poor groundwater. We show that these habitat shifts are associated with higher transcriptome-wide [Formula: see text] After ruling out the role of positive selection and pseudogenization, we show that these transcriptome-wide [Formula: see text] increases are the consequence of a reduction in selection efficacy imposed by the smaller effective population size of subterranean species. This reduction is paralleled by an important increase in genome size (25\% increase on average), an increase also confirmed in subterranean decapods and mollusks. We also control for an adaptive impact of genome size on life history traits but find no correlation between body size, or growth rate, and genome size. We show instead that the independent increases in genome size measured in subterranean isopods are the direct consequence of increasing invasion rates by repeat elements, which are less efficiently purged out by purifying selection. Contrary to selection efficacy, polymorphism is not correlated to genome size. We propose that recent demographic fluctuations and the difficulty of observing polymorphism variation in polymorphism-poor species can obfuscate the link between effective population size and genome size when polymorphism data are used alone.},

Most notably, empirical evidence indicates that mutation rates are elevated in multicellular species relative to unicellular eukaryotes and prokaryotes, even on a per-cell division basis, despite the need for the avoidance of somatic damage and the accumulation of germline mutations. Here it is suggested that multicellularity discourages selection against weak mutator alleles for reasons associated with both the cellular and the population-genetic environments, thereby magnifying the vulnerability to somatic mutations (cancer) and increasing the risk of extinction from the accumulation of germline mutations. Moreover, contrary to common belief, a cost of fidelity need not be invoked to explain the lower bound to observed mutation rates, which instead may simply be set by the inability of selection to advance very weakly advantageous antimutator alleles in finite populations.},

As a consequence of an expansion in genome size, some microbial eukaryotes with large Ne appear to have evolved mutation rates that are lower than those known to occur in prokaryotes, but multicellular eukaryotes have experienced elevations in the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate because of substantial reductions in Ne.},

In this theory natural selection plays the most important role in determining the extent of genetic polymorphism and the rate of evolution. Although mutation is regarded as the ultimate source of genetic variation, its role in evolution is considered to be minor. This is because mutation occurs repeatedly at the phenotypic level and most natural populations seem to carry a sufficient amount of genetic variability, so that almost any genetic change can occur by natural selection whenever the change is needed. Namely, natural selection plays a creative role (Mayr 1963; Dobzhansky 1970). This is in sharp contrast to the mutationist’s view of evolution that prevailed in the first quarter of this century (e.g., Morgan 1925, 1932). In mutationism (in Morgan’s sense not de Vries’) natural selection plays a less important role than mutation, and its chief role is to preserve rare useful mutations and eliminate unfit genotypes; all creative roles are given to mutation. In the 1930’s and 1940’s mutationism gradually became unpopular among biologists for various reasons, and by 1950 it almost disappeared.},

	abstract = {The neutral theory of molecular evolution has been widely accepted and is the guiding principle for studying evolutionary genomics and the molecular basis of phenotypic evolution. Recent data on genomic evolution are generally consistent with the neutral theory. However, many recently published papers claim the detection of positive Darwinian selection via the use of new statistical methods. Examination of these methods has shown that their theoretical bases are not well established and often result in high rates of false-positive and false-negative results. When the deficiencies of these statistical methods are rectified, the results become largely consistent with the neutral theory. At present, genome-wide analyses of natural selection consist of collections of single-locus analyses. However, because phenotypic evolution is controlled by the interaction of many genes, the study of natural selection ought to take such interactions into account. Experimental studies of evolution will also be crucial.},

	abstract = {In sharp contrast to the Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection, the neutral theory claims that the overwhelming majority of evolutionary changes at the molecular level are caused by random fixation (due to random sampling drift in finite populations) of selectively neutral (i.e., selectively equivalent) mutants under continued inputs of mutations. The theory also asserts that most of the genetic variability within species at the molecular level (such as protein and DNA polymorphism) are selectively neutral or very nearly neutral and that they are maintained in the species by the balance between mutational input and random extinction. The neutral theory is based on simple assumptions, enabling us to develop mathematical theories based on population genetics to treat molecular evolution and variation in quantitative terms. The theory can be tested against actual observations. Neo-Darwinians continue to criticize the neutral theory, but evidence for it has accumulated over the last two decades. The recent outpouring of DNA sequence data has greatly strengthened the theory. In this paper, I review some recent observations that strongly support the neutral theory. They include such topics as pseudoglobin genes of the mouse, alpha A-crystallin genes of the blind mole rat, genes of influenza A virus and nuclear vs. mitochondrial genes of fruit flies. I also discuss such topics as the evolution of deviant coding systems in Mycoplasma, the origin of life and the unified understanding of molecular and phenotypic evolution. I conclude that since the origin of life on Earth, neutral evolutionary changes have predominated over Darwinian evolutionary changes, at least in number.},

	doi = {10.1017/S0370164600044886},
	abstract = {The discussion of the distribution of the gene ratio of the author's paper of 1922 is amended by the use of a more exact form of the differential equation to be satisfied. It appears that the time needed to halve the variance by random extinction of genes in the total absence of mutations should be 1·4 instead of 2·8 times the number of potential parents in each generation. Either value shows that the loss of variance due to this cause is too trifling to be appreciable in the balance of causes which maintain the actual genetic variability of species.The same correction alters the distribution appropriate for the maintenance of variability at a fixed level by mutations in the absence of selection. The new solution closely resembles the form previously obtained and now confirmed for the practical case in which selection is present. The method of differential equations, however, fails to deal satisfactorily with these cases, owing to the failure of the integrals to converge at the termini representing cases in which one or other allelomorph is extremely rare.A method of functional equations is developed for dealing with the termini, and is shown to lead to the same solutions as the amended differential equations in the central portion of the range for which the latter are valid, and further to give the terminal distribution of rare allelomorphs. The method requires the investigation of a continuous function uv of argument v satisfying the recurrence formula From the asymptotic form of this function its expansion in the neighbourhood of u = 0 is derived, giving the frequencies of the required distributions.Exceedingly minute values for the selective advantage or disadvantage make a great difference to (i) the chance of success of a mutation and (ii) the contributions of such mutations to the specific variance. The order of magnitude to be considered is the inverse of the population of the species. The neutral zone of selective advantage in the neighbourhood of zero is thus so narrow that changes in the environment, and in the genetic constitution of species, must cause this zone to be crossed and perhaps recrossed relatively rapidly in the course of evolutionary change, so that many possible gene substitutions may have a fluctuating history of advance and regression before the final balance of selective advantage is determined.},

	abstract = {Understanding selection in the wild remains a major aim of evolutionary ecology and work by Ford and colleagues on the meadow brown butterfly Maniola jurtina did much to ignite this agenda. A great deal of their work was conducted during the 1950s on the Isles of Scilly. They documented island-specific wing-spot patterns that remained consistent over about a decade, but patterns on some islands changed after environmental perturbation. It was suggested that these wing-spot patterns reflected island-specific selection and that there was little migration between islands. However, genetic studies to test the underlying assumption of restricted migration are lacking and it is also unknown whether the originally described wing-spot patterns have persisted over time. We therefore collected female butterflies from five of Ford’s original study locations, including three large islands (St Mary’s, St Martin’s and Tresco) and two small islands (Tean and St Helen’s). Wing-spot patterns had not changed appreciably over time on three of the islands (two large and one small), but were significantly different on the other two. Furthermore, analysis of 176 amplified fragment length polymorphisms revealed significant genome-wide differentiation among the five islands. Our findings are consistent with Ford’s conclusions that despite the close proximity of these islands, there is restricted gene flow among them.},

En réalité, la révolution dite darwinienne s’insère au cœur d’une révolution intellectuelle beaucoup plus importante : la révolution transformiste. Avant d’être des darwiniens, de dignes représentants de cette mouvance s’afficheront comme étant des transformistes. Cela signifie que, en plus des mécanismes de l’évolution biologique, d’autres éléments tout aussi cruciaux seront pris en considération dans l’élaboration d’une véritable synthèse évolutionniste : les rapports entre l’évolution biologique et l’évolution cosmique les interrogations portant sur la question d’une possible direction évolutive l’enseignement à tirer pour l’homme de sa place et de son rôle dans la nature.
À la croisée de l’histoire, de la philosophie et de la science, cet ouvrage cherche à démontrer, à travers l’analyse des travaux de plusieurs néo-darwiniens de premier plan, que la révolution darwinienne demeurera incomplète aussi longtemps que la révolution transformiste le restera.},

Gould and Provine argue that Wright's shifting balance theory of evolution hardened during this period. But their account does not do justice to Wright, who always regarded selection as acting together with drift. This paper presents a more adequate account of the development of Wright's shifting balance theory, paying particular attention to his application of the theory to the geographical distribution of flower color dimorphism in Linanthus parryae. The account shows that even in the heyday of the hardened synthesis, the balance or interaction of evolutionary factors, such as drift, selection, and migration, occupied pride of place in Wright's theory, and that between the 1940s and 1970s, Wright developed the theory of isolation by distance to quantitatively represent the structure of the Linanthus population, which he argued had the kind of structure posited by his shifting balance theory. In the end, Wright arrived at a sophisticated description of the structure of the Linanthus population, where the interaction between drift and selection varied spatially.},

	abstract = {Mendel and Darwin were contemporaries, with much overlap in their scientifically productive years. Available evidence shows that Mendel knew much about Darwin, whereas Darwin knew nothing of Mendel. Because of the fragmentary nature of this evidence, published inferences regarding Mendel’s views on Darwinian evolution are contradictory and enigmatic, with claims ranging from enthusiastic acceptance to outright rejection. The objective of this review is to examine evidence from Mendel’s published and private writings on evolution and Darwin, and the influence of the scientific environment in which he was immersed. Much of this evidence lies in Mendel’s handwritten annotations in his copies of Darwin’s books, which this review scrutinises in detail. Darwin’s writings directly influenced Mendel’s classic 1866 paper, and his letters to Nägeli. He commended and criticised Darwin on specific issues pertinent to his research, including the provisional hypothesis of pangenesis, the role of pollen in fertilisation, and the influence of “conditions of life” on heritable variation. In his final letter to Nägeli, Mendel proposed a Darwinian scenario for natural selection using the same German term for “struggle for existence” as in his copies of Darwin’s books. His published and private scientific writings are entirely objective, devoid of polemics or religious allusions, and address evolutionary questions in a manner consistent with that of his scientific contemporaries. The image that emerges of Mendel is of a meticulous scientist who accepted the tenets of Darwinian evolution, while privately pinpointing aspects of Darwin’s views of inheritance that were not supported by Mendel’s own experiments.},

He took pride instead in advancing the ideas that (1) nature produced successively all the different forms of life on earth, and (2) environmentally induced behavioral changes lead the way in species change. This article surveys Lamarck’s ideas about organic change, identifies several ironies with respect to how his name is commonly remembered, and suggests that some historical justice might be done by using the adjective “Lamarckian” to denote something more (or other) than a belief in the inheritance of acquired characters.},

Here, we elucidate how this coupling is first established and why it disappears. Overexpressing cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) in Xenopus oocytes specifically improved translation of short-tailed mRNAs, thereby diminishing coupling between tail length and TE. Thus, strong coupling requires limiting PABPC, implying that in coupled systems longer-tail mRNAs better compete for limiting PABPC. In addition to expressing excess PABPC, post-embryonic mammalian cell lines had two other properties that prevented strong coupling: terminal-uridylation-dependent destabilization of mRNAs lacking bound PABPC, and a regulatory regime wherein PABPC contributes minimally to TE. Thus, these results revealed three fundamental mechanistic requirements for coupling and defined the context-dependent functions for PABPC, which promotes TE but not mRNA stability in coupled systems and mRNA stability but not TE in uncoupled systems.},

	abstract = {All nuclear-encoded eukaryotic messenger RNAs possess a 5' cap structure (m7GpppN) and, with a few exceptions, alsPreisso a 3' poly(A) tail. These modifications are added as part of the mRNA processing pathway during or immediately after transcription in the nucleus. Subsequently, they both influence different aspects of mRNA metabolism including splicing, transport, stability and translation. The cap structure has an important role during the initiation phase of translation as it recruits ribosomes and associated factors to the mRNA. The poly(A) tail can also stimulate translation and cooperates with the cap structure in a synergistic fashion. The eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4G plays a central part as a multifunctional adapter, which brings together various components of the translation apparatus. Through simultaneous interactions with the cap-binding protein eIF4E and the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), eIF4G is able to bridge the two ends of the mRNA. The resulting pseudo-circular structure of the mRNA is thought to have important functional consequences for the translation process. The importance of the poly(A) tail is further underscored by the fact that the regulated variation of its length on maternal mRNAs is an integral part of gene regulation during oocyte maturation and in early embryonic development. Finally, the majority of cellular mRNAs are degraded by processes that are interconnected with translation and are initiated by poly(A) tail shortening.},

	abstract = {Poly(A) tails, present on almost every eukaryotic mRNA, were discovered over 50 years ago. Early experiments led to the hypothesis that poly(A) tails and the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein promote translation and prevent mRNA degradation, but the details remained unclear. More recent data suggest that the role of poly(A) tails is much more complex: poly(A)-binding protein can stimulate poly(A) tail removal (deadenylation), and the poly(A) tails of stable, highly-translated mRNAs at steady state are much shorter than expected. Moreover, the rate of translation elongation impacts deadenylation. Together, the interplay between poly(A) tails, poly(A)-binding protein, translation, and mRNA decay plays a major role in regulating gene expression. In this review, we summarize recent work that is revolutionizing the field and changing our perspective on the roles of poly(A) tails in the cytoplasm. Specifically, we discuss the roles of poly(A) tails in translation and mRNA stability, and how poly(A) tails are removed by exonucleases (deadenylases) including Ccr4-Not and Pan2-Pan3. We also cover major topics of current research, including how deadenylation rate is determined, the integration of deadenylation with other cellular processes, and the function of the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein. Finally, we provide an outlook for the future of research in this area.},

	abstract = {Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is an mRNA quality-control mechanism that typifies all eukaryotes examined to date. NMD surveys newly synthesized mRNAs and degrades those that harbor a premature termination codon (PTC), thereby preventing the production of truncated proteins that could result in disease in humans. This is evident from dominantly inherited diseases that are due to PTC-containing mRNAs that escape NMD. Although many cellular NMD targets derive from mistakes made during, for example, pre-mRNA splicing and, possibly, transcription initiation, NMD also targets ∼10\% of normal physiological mRNAs so as to promote an appropriate cellular response to changing environmental milieus, including those that induce apoptosis, maturation or differentiation. Over the past ∼35 years, a central goal in the NMD field has been to understand how cells discriminate mRNAs that are targeted by NMD from those that are not. In this Cell Science at a Glance and the accompanying poster, we review progress made towards this goal, focusing on human studies and the role of the key NMD factor up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1)., Summary: In humans, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay prevents the synthesis of potentially toxic proteins from mutated mRNAs, and also regulates 10\% of physiological mRNAs that promote cellular adaptation to changing environments.},

In mammalian cells, NMD is also linked to pre-mRNA splicing, as in many instances strong mRNA reduction occurs only when the PTC is located upstream of an intron. It is proposed that in these systems, the exon junction complex (EJC) mediates the link between splicing and NMD. Recent studies have questioned the role of splicing and the EJC in initiating NMD. Instead, they put forward a general and evolutionarily conserved mechanism in which the main regulator of NMD is the distance between a PTC and the poly(A) tail of an mRNA. Here we discuss the limitations of the new NMD model and the EJC concept; we argue that neither satisfactorily accounts for all of the available data and offer a new model to test in future studies.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that there can be large differences in the stability of double and triple helical nucleic acid complexes, depending on whether RNA or DNA strands are involved. These differences have been attributed to structural differences in the sugar-phosphate backbone of these two polymers. However, since there are in fact two structural features which distinguish DNA from RNA (the 2'-hydroxyl and C-5 methyl groups), the stability differences may arise from either or both of these factors. We have separated effects of the 2'-hydroxyl and C-5 methyl groups by synthesizing nucleic acid strands which contain all possible combinations with and without these groups. Studies of the stabilities of double and triple helices involving these strands show that in fact the C-5 methyl group of thymine and the 2'-OH group of ribose have equally large effects on stability. The two effects vary with secondary structure and can be reinforcing or even opposing in their influence on stability. Three types of complexes are specifically examined: bimolecular pyrimidine.purine duplexes, termolecular pyrimidine.purine.pyrimidine triplexes, and bimolecular triplexes formed from circular pyrimidine oligonucleotides with purine target strands. It is found in general that the two types of substitutional effects are independent of one another and that C-5 methyl groups are in all cases stabilizing, while 2'-OH groups can be stabilizing or destabilizing, depending on the type of complex. In addition, studies with partially methylated duplexes lend evidence that the largest contribution to stabilization by the methyl group arises from increased base stacking ability rather than from a favorable hydrophobic methyl-methyl contact.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The processes that regulate mRNA half-lives can, in turn, affect how cells grow, differentiate, and respond to their environment. Three major questions are addressed. Which sequences in mRNAs determine their half-lives? Which enzymes degrade mRNAs? Which (trans-acting) factors regulate mRNA stability, and how do they function? The following specific topics are discussed: techniques for measuring eukaryotic mRNA stability and for calculating decay constants, mRNA decay pathways, mRNases, proteins that bind to sequences shared among many mRNAs [like poly(A)- and AU-rich-binding proteins] and proteins that bind to specific mRNAs (like the c-myc coding-region determinant-binding protein), how environmental factors like hormones and growth factors affect mRNA stability, and how translation and mRNA stability are linked.

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that play important roles in regulating gene expression. The majority of miRNAs are transcribed from DNA sequences into primary miRNAs and processed into precursor miRNAs, and finally mature miRNAs. In most cases, miRNAs interact with the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of target mRNAs to induce mRNA degradation and translational repression. However, interaction of miRNAs with other regions, including the 5′ UTR, coding sequence, and gene promoters, have also been reported. Under certain conditions, miRNAs can also activate translation or regulate transcription. The interaction of miRNAs with their target genes is dynamic and dependent on many factors, such as subcellular location of miRNAs, the abundancy of miRNAs and target mRNAs, and the affinity of miRNA-mRNA interactions. miRNAs can be secreted into extracellular fluids and transported to target cells via vesicles, such as exosomes, or by binding to proteins, including Argonautes. Extracellular miRNAs function as chemical messengers to mediate cell-cell communication. In this review, we provide an update on canonical and non-canonical miRNA biogenesis pathways and various mechanisms underlying miRNA-mediated gene regulations. We also summarize the current knowledge of the dynamics of miRNA action and of the secretion, transfer, and uptake of extracellular miRNAs.},

	abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

	abstract = {Determining the full complement of protein-coding genes is a key goal of genome annotation. The most powerful approach for confirming protein-coding potential is the detection of cellular protein expression through peptide mass spectrometry (MS) experiments. Here, we mapped peptides detected in seven large-scale proteomics studies to almost 60\% of the protein-coding genes in the GENCODE annotation of the human genome. We found a strong relationship between detection in proteomics experiments and both gene family age and cross-species conservation. Most of the genes for which we detected peptides were highly conserved. We found peptides for \&gt;96\% of genes that evolved before bilateria. At the opposite end of the scale, we identified almost no peptides for genes that have appeared since primates, for genes that did not have any protein-like features or for genes with poor cross-species conservation. These results motivated us to describe a set of 2001 potential non-coding genes based on features such as weak conservation, a lack of protein features, or ambiguous annotations from major databases, all of which correlated with low peptide detection across the seven experiments. We identified peptides for just 3\% of these genes. We show that many of these genes behave more like non-coding genes than protein-coding genes and suggest that most are unlikely to code for proteins under normal circumstances. We believe that their inclusion in the human protein-coding gene catalogue should be revised as part of the ongoing human genome annotation effort.},

	abstract = {Although the Human Genome Project was completed 4 years ago, the catalog of human protein-coding genes remains a matter of controversy. Current catalogs list a total of ≈24,500 putative protein-coding genes. It is broadly suspected that a large fraction of these entries are functionally meaningless ORFs present by chance in RNA transcripts, because they show no evidence of evolutionary conservation with mouse or dog. However, there is currently no scientific justification for excluding ORFs simply because they fail to show evolutionary conservation: the alternative hypothesis is that most of these ORFs are actually valid human genes that reflect gene innovation in the primate lineage or gene loss in the other lineages. Here, we reject this hypothesis by carefully analyzing the nonconserved ORFs—specifically, their properties in other primates. We show that the vast majority of these ORFs are random occurrences. The analysis yields, as a by-product, a major revision of the current human catalogs, cutting the number of protein-coding genes to ≈20,500. Specifically, it suggests that nonconserved ORFs should be added to the human gene catalog only if there is clear evidence of an encoded protein. It also provides a principled methodology for evaluating future proposed additions to the human gene catalog. Finally, the results indicate that there has been relatively little true innovation in mammalian protein-coding genes.},

	abstract = {Strategies for large-scale genomic DNA sequencing currently require physical mapping, followed by detailed mapping, and finally sequencing. The level of mapping detail determines the amount of effort, or sequence redundancy, required to finish a project. Current strategies attempt to find a balance between mapping and sequencing efforts. One such approach is to employ strategies that use sequence data to build physical maps. Such maps alleviate the need for prior mapping and reduce the final required sequence redundancy. To this end, the utility of correlating pairs of sequence data derived from both ends of subcloned templates is well recognized. However, optimal strategies employing such pairwise data have not been established. In the present work, we simulate and analyze the parameters of pairwise sequencing projects including template length, sequence read length, and total sequence redundancy. One pairwise strategy based on sequencing both ends of plasmid subclones is recommended and illustrated with raw data simulations. We find that pairwise strategies are effective with both small (cosmid) and large (megaYAC) targets and produce ordered sequence data with a high level of mapping completeness. They are ideal for fine-scale mapping and gene finding and as initial steps for either a high- or a low-redundancy sequencing effort. Such strategies are highly automatable.},

	abstract = {Determination of the complete nucleotide sequence of the human genome will require accurate, efficient, and automated DNA sequencing methods. The random DNA sequencing strategy is being utilized in large-scale sequencing projects at present and is being considered for incorporation into the methods that will be utilized in the sequencing of genomes. Herein we present some concepts relevant to random DNA sequencing and discuss the design and implementation of the method. Strategies for overlapping contigs and sequencing gaps are suggested and discussed in detail, as the closure phase appears to be the limiting step in efficient application of random DNA sequencing approaches. Performance of a modified random DNA sequencing strategy used to sequence 60 kb of the human HPRT locus is presented in the context of closure. It is suggested that the efficiency of random DNA sequencing may be improved by simple modifications facilitating closure.},

Here, we report the results of an international collaboration to produce a high-quality draft sequence of the mouse genome. We also present an initial comparative analysis of the mouse and human genomes, describing some of the insights that can be gleaned from the two sequences. We discuss topics including the analysis of the evolutionary forces shaping the size, structure and sequence of the genomes; the conservation of large-scale synteny across most of the genomes; the much lower extent of sequence orthology covering less than half of the genomes; the proportions of the genomes under selection; the number of protein-coding genes; the expansion of gene families related to reproduction and immunity; the evolution of proteins; and the identification of intraspecies polymorphism.},

	abstract = {The flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana is an important model system for identifying genes and determining their functions. Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication, followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications, giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25,498 genes encoding proteins from 11,000 families, similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila  and Caenorhabditis elegans— the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families, indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes. This is the first complete genome sequence of a plant and provides the foundations for more comprehensive comparison of conserved processes in all eukaryotes, identifying a wide range of plant-specific gene functions and establishing rapid systematic ways to identify genes for crop improvement.},

The genomic sequence provides access to the complete structures of all genes, including those without known function, their control elements, and, by inference, the proteins they encode, as well as all other biologically important sequences. Furthermore, the sequence is a rich and permanent source of information for the design of further biological studies of the organism and for the study of evolution through cross-species sequence comparison. The power of this approach has been amply demonstrated by the determination of the sequences of a number of microbial and model organisms. The next step is to obtain the complete sequence of the entire human genome. Here we report the sequence of the euchromatic part of human chromosome 22. The sequence obtained consists of 12 contiguous segments spanning 33.4 megabases, contains at least 545 genes and 134 pseudogenes, and provides the first view of the complex chromosomal landscapes that will be found in the rest of the genome.},

As a result, 5-methylcytosine residues are hotspots for spontaneous transitions, as demonstrated in the lacI gene of Escherichia coli. We show here that in bacteria which lack uracil-DNA glycosylase (Ung−) and cannot excise uracil residues from DNA, the rate of spontaneous transition at cytosine residues is raised to the hotspot rate at 5-methylcytosine residues. These studies provide direct evidence that the deamination of cytosine is a significant source of spontaneous mutations.},

	abstract = {An electrophoretically slow albumin variant was detected with a phenotype frequency of about 1:1000 in Sweden and was also found in a family of Scottish descent from Kaikoura, New Zealand, and in five families in Tradate, Italy. Structural study established that the major variant component was arginyl-albumin, in which arginine at the -1 position of the propeptide is still attached to the processed albumin. A minor component with the amino-terminal sequence of proalbumin was also present as 3-6\% of the total albumin. After amplification of the gene segment encoding the prepro sequence of albumin, specific hybridization of DNA to an oligonucleotide probe encoding cysteine at position -2 indicated the mutation of arginine at the -2 position to cysteine (-2 Arg----Cys). This produced the propeptide sequence Arg-Gly-Val-Phe-Cys-Arg. This was confirmed by sequence analysis after pyridylethylation of the cysteine. This mutation produces an alternate signal peptidase cleavage site in the variant proalbumin precursor of arginyl-albumin giving rise to two possible products, arginyl-albumin and the variant proalbumin. Another plasma from Bremen had an alloalbumin with a previously described substitution (1 Asp----Val), which also affects propeptide cleavage. Hypermutability of two CpG dinucleotides in the codons for the diarginyl sequence may account for the frequency of mutations in the propeptide. Mutation at these two sites results in a series of recurrent proalbumin variants that have arisen independently in diverse populations.},

We analyzed more than 1000 orthologous genes in 33 fully sequenced mammalian genomes, reconstructed their ancestral isochore organization in the maximum likelihood framework, and explored the evolution of third-codon position GC content in representatives of 16 orders and 27 families. We showed that the previously reported erosion of GC-rich isochores is not a general trend. Several species (e.g., shrew, microbat, tenrec, rabbit) have independently undergone a marked increase in GC content, with a widening gap between the GC-poorest and GC-richest classes of genes. The intensively studied apes and (especially) murids do not reflect the general placental pattern. We correlated GC-content evolution with species life-history traits and cytology. Significant effects of body mass and genome size were detected, with each being consistent with the GC-biased gene conversion model.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1000071},
	abstract = {Unraveling the evolutionary forces responsible for variations of neutral substitution patterns among taxa or along genomes is a major issue for detecting selection within sequences. Mammalian genomes show large-scale regional variations of GC-content (the isochores), but the substitution processes at the origin of this structure are poorly understood. We analyzed the pattern of neutral substitutions in 1 Gb of primate non-coding regions. We show that the GC-content toward which sequences are evolving is strongly negatively correlated to the distance to telomeres and positively correlated to the rate of crossovers (R2 = 47\%). This demonstrates that recombination has a major impact on substitution patterns in human, driving the evolution of GC-content. The evolution of GC-content correlates much more strongly with male than with female crossover rate, which rules out selectionist models for the evolution of isochores. This effect of recombination is most probably a consequence of the neutral process of biased gene conversion (BGC) occurring within recombination hotspots. We show that the predictions of this model fit very well with the observed substitution patterns in the human genome. This model notably explains the positive correlation between substitution rate and recombination rate. Theoretical calculations indicate that variations in population size or density in recombination hotspots can have a very strong impact on the evolution of base composition. Furthermore, recombination hotspots can create strong substitution hotspots. This molecular drive affects both coding and non-coding regions. We therefore conclude that along with mutation, selection and drift, BGC is one of the major factors driving genome evolution. Our results also shed light on variations in the rate of crossover relative to non-crossover events, along chromosomes and according to sex, and also on the conservation of hotspot density between human and chimp.},

Recombination events, however, are also accompanied by short-scale, unidirectional exchanges known as gene conversion in the neighborhood of the initiating double-strand break. A large body of evidence suggests that gene conversion is GC-biased in many eukaryotes, including mammals and human. AT/GC heterozygotes produce more GC- than AT-gametes, thus conferring a population advantage to GC-alleles in high-recombining regions. This apparently unimportant feature of our molecular machinery has major evolutionary consequences. Structurally, GC-biased gene conversion explains the spatial distribution of GC-content in mammalian genomes-the so-called isochore structure. Functionally, GC-biased gene conversion promotes the segregation and fixation of deleterious AT --{\textgreater} GC mutations, thus increasing our genomic mutation load. Here we review the recent evidence for a GC-biased gene conversion process in mammals, and its consequences for genomic landscapes, molecular evolution, and human functional genomics.},

Here, we have revealed lower dN/dS ratio of BSGs than WEGs in human-mouse, human-orangutan, human-chimpanzee and mouse-rat orthologous pair. The significance level of dN/dS ratio difference indicates a trend of decreasing difference as complexity of compared pairs increases. Further studies with the human-mouse pair revealed that, removal of the duplicated genes from both the dataset has nullified this difference which dictates a vital role of duplicated genes in governing the selection pressure. Conclusively, higher paralog number, expression level, and longer regulatory region length of BSGs allow fewer nucleotide substitutions within them. Our results show for the first time to our knowledge lower dN/dS ratio of BSGs than WEGs.},

First, the introduction of a general model of selection at a single locus, which showed how variability could be maintained by heterozygote advantage. Second, the use of the branching process approach to show that a beneficial mutation has a substantial chance of loss from the population, even when the population size is extremely large. Third, the invention of the concept of a probability distribution of allele frequency, caused by random sampling of allele frequencies due to finite population size, and the first use of a diffusion equation to investigate the properties of such a distribution. Although Fisher was motivated by an inference that later turned out to lack strong empirical support (a substantial contribution of dominance to quantitative trait variability), and his use of a diffusion equation was marred by a technical mistake, the paper introduced concepts and methods that pervade much subsequent work in population genetics.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary theories are critical for understanding cancer development at the level of species as well as at the level of cells and tissues, and for developing effective therapies. Animals have evolved potent tumor suppressive mechanisms to prevent cancer development. These mechanisms were initially necessary for the evolution of multi-cellular organisms, and became even more important as animals evolved large bodies and long lives. Indeed, the development and architecture of our tissues were evolutionarily constrained by the need to limit cancer. Cancer development within an individual is also an evolutionary process, which in many respects mirrors species evolution. Species evolve by mutation and selection acting on individuals in a population; tumors evolve by mutation and selection acting on cells in a tissue. The processes of mutation and selection are integral to the evolution of cancer at every step of multistage carcinogenesis, from tumor genesis to metastasis. Factors associated with cancer development, such as aging and carcinogens, have been shown to promote cancer evolution by impacting both mutation and selection processes. While there are therapies that can decimate a cancer cell population, unfortunately, cancers can also evolve resistance to these therapies, leading to the resurgence of treatment-refractory disease. Understanding cancer from an evolutionary perspective can allow us to appreciate better why cancers predominantly occur in the elderly, and why other conditions, from radiation exposure to smoking, are associated with increased cancers. Importantly, the application of evolutionary theory to cancer should engender new treatment strategies that could better control this dreaded disease.},

Human genetic and linguistic diversity have been proposed to be generally correlated, either through a direct link, whereby linguistic and genetic affiliations reflect the same past population processes, or an indirect one, where the evolution of the two types of diversity is independent but conditioned by the same geographical factors. By controlling for proximity, indirect correlations due to common geography are eliminated, and any residual relationships found are likely to reflect common linguistic-genetic processes. Clear relationships between genetic distances and linguistic relatedness are detectable in Europe and East and Central Asia, but not in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, or West Africa. We suggest that linguistic and genetic affiliations will only be correlated under specific conditions, such as where there have been large-scale demic diffusions in the last few thousand years, and relative sedentism in the subsequent period.},

Fisher tried to capture in the formula the change in population fitness attributable to changes of allele frequencies, when all else is not included. Lessard's formulation comes closest to Fisher's intention, as well as this can be judged. Additional terms can be added to account for other changes. The "theorem" as stated by Fisher is not exact, and therefore not a theorem, but it does encapsulate a great deal of evolutionary meaning in a simple statement. I also discuss the effectiveness of reproductive-value weighting and the theorem in integrated form. Finally, an optimum principle, analogous to least action and Hamilton's principle in physics, is discussed.},

	abstract = {Organisms can change their physiological/behavioural traits to adapt and survive in changed environments. However, whether these acquired traits can be inherited across generations through non-genetic alterations has been a topic of debate for over a century. Emerging evidence indicates that both ancestral and parental experiences, including nutrition, environmental toxins, nurturing behaviour, and social stress, can have powerful effects on the physiological, metabolic and cellular functions in an organism. In certain circumstances, these effects can be transmitted across several generations through epigenetic (i.e. non-DNA sequence-based rather than mutational) modifications. In this review, we summarize recent evidence on epigenetic inheritance from parental environment-induced developmental and physiological alterations in nematodes, fruit flies, zebrafish, rodents, and humans. The epigenetic modifications demonstrated to be both susceptible to modulation by environmental cues and heritable, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and small non-coding RNAs, are also summarized. We particularly focus on evidence that parental environment-induced epigenetic alterations are transmitted through both the maternal and paternal germlines and exert sex-specific effects. The thought-provoking data presented here raise fundamental questions about the mechanisms responsible for these phenomena. In particular, the means that define the specificity of the response to parental experience in the gamete epigenome and that direct the establishment of the specific epigenetic change in the developing embryos, as well as in specific tissues in the descendants, remain obscure and require elucidation. More precise epigenetic assessment at both the genome-wide level and single-cell resolution as well as strategies for breeding at relatively sensitive periods of development and manipulation aimed at specific epigenetic modification are imperative for identifying parental environment-induced epigenetic marks across generations. Considering their diverse epigenetic architectures, the conservation and prevalence of the mechanisms underlying epigenetic inheritance in non-mammals require further investigation in mammals. Interpretation of the consequences arising from epigenetic inheritance on organisms and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms will provide insight into how gene–environment interactions shape developmental processes and physiological functions, which in turn may have wide-ranging implications for human health, and understanding biological adaptation and evolution.},

	abstract = {This book attempts to critique the evolution theory. It pays attention to one of the most debated questions among evolutionists today, namely, the bearing of the recent discoveries in genetics and in mutation on the theory of evolution. While in a general way Darwin's theory of Natural Selection is independent of the origin of the new variations that furnish it with its materials, yet the scientific formulation of the theory is intimately connected with the origin and inheritance of suitable variations. For instance, if most of the observed variability of animals and plants were due directly to the environment, and if the effects thus brought about were not inherited, such variability could no longer be appealed to as material for natural selection. Again, if the variations that appear as mutants are always defective types, they could not, even though they are inherited, be appealed to as furnishing material for progressive evolution. A discussion of these two problems in their historical setting is one of the principal themes treated in the following pages. The four original lectures (chapters) have been subdivided and enlarged into thirteen chapters. Two of these are entirely new, one dealing with the noninheritance of acquired characters (copied with slight changes from the Yale Review for July 1924), the other a criticism of the evidence of human inheritance. The somewhat acrimonious discussion taking place at the present time concerning racial differences in man, a discussion in which "nature" and "nurture" are often confused, may furnish an excuse for the addition of this final chapter.

	abstract = {Charles Darwin proposed that evolution occurs primarily by natural selection, but this view has been controversial from the beginning. Two of the major opposing views have been mutationism and neutralism. Early molecular studies suggested that most amino acid substitutions in proteins are neutral or nearly neutral and the functional change of proteins occurs by a few key amino acid substitutions. This suggestion generated an intense controversy over selectionism and neutralism. This controversy is partially caused by Kimura's definition of neutrality, which was too strict ({\textbar}2Ns{\textbar} ≤ 1). If we define neutral mutations as the mutations that do not change the function of gene products appreciably, many controversies disappear because slightly deleterious and slightly advantageous mutations are engulfed by neutral mutations. The ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution to that of synonymous substitution is a useful quantity to study positive Darwinian selection operating at highly variable genetic loci, but it does not necessarily detect adaptively important codons. Previously, multigene families were thought to evolve following the model of concerted evolution, but new evidence indicates that most of them evolve by a birth-and-death process of duplicate genes. It is now clear that most phenotypic characters or genetic systems such as the adaptive immune system in vertebrates are controlled by the interaction of a number of multigene families, which are often evolutionarily related and are subject to birth-and-death evolution. Therefore, it is important to study the mechanisms of gene family interaction for understanding phenotypic evolution. Because gene duplication occurs more or less at random, phenotypic evolution contains some fortuitous elements, though the environmental factors also play an important role. The randomness of phenotypic evolution is qualitatively different from allele frequency changes by random genetic drift. However, there is some similarity between phenotypic and molecular evolution with respect to functional or environmental constraints and evolutionary rate. It appears that mutation (including gene duplication and other DNA changes) is the driving force of evolution at both the genic and the phenotypic levels.},

Since abnormal hemoglobins mostly reflect the process of mutation rather than selection, the correlation manifest during protein evolution between substitution frequency and physico-chemical difference in amino acids can be attributed to natural selection. Outside of ‘abnormal’ proteins, the correlation also does not apply to certain regions of proteins characterized by rapid rates of substitution. In these cases again, except for the largest physico-chemical differences between amino acid pairs, the substitution frequencies seem to be independent of the physico-chemical parameters. The limination of the substituents involving the largest physicochemical differences can once more be attributed to natural selection. For smaller physico-chemical differences, natural selection, if it is operating in the polypeptide regions, must be based on parameters other than those examined.},

This measure is the overall resemblance between the 20 “natural” amino acids based on a large number of their physico-chemical properties. The amino acids were classified into groups similar in many ways to those commonly recognized. A Principal Component analysis yielded four vectors, which represent major composite chemical factors. Correlations were studied between the change in biological activity and the chemical change on substitution of one or more amino acids. As expected, there was in general a major change in biological activity if a major change was made in chemical structure. The variation was due to three effects: (a) a correlation between activity and overall resemblance of individual pairs of amino acids (as shown by comparisons involving only a single amino acid substitution); (b) a correlation with the total number of amino acids substituted, irrespective of which ones they were; and (c), the major part, variation that was unaccounted for by (a) or (b). Correlations were also noted between the four vectors and biological activity. This suggests that predictions on the biological activity of new peptides might be possible. Such predictions would probably be better than chance, though not of high accuracy.},

Here we provide genomic evidence in budding yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells that the efficiency-accuracy conflict is alleviated by slowing down the elongation at structurally or functionally important residues to ensure their translational accuracies while sacrificing the accuracy for speed at other residues. Our computational analysis in yeast with codon resolution suggests that mRNA secondary structures serve as elongation brakes to control the speed and hence the fidelity of protein translation. The position-specific effect of mRNA folding on translational accuracy is further demonstrated experimentally by swapping synonymous codons in a yeast transgene. Our findings explain why highly expressed genes tend to have strong mRNA folding, slow translational elongation, and conserved protein sequences. The exquisite codon-by-codon translational modulation uncovered here is a testament to the power of natural selection in mitigating efficiency-accuracy conflicts, which are prevalent in biology.},

Furthermore, aside from those that affect splicing, synonymous mutations are typically ignored as potential contributors to disease. Using genetic sequencing data from nearly 200,000 individuals, we uncover clear evidence that natural selection optimizes codon content in the human genome. In deriving intolerance metrics to quantify gene-level constraint on synonymous variation, we discover that dosage-sensitive genes, DNA-damage-response genes, and cell-cycle-regulated genes are particularly intolerant to synonymous variation. Notably, we illustrate that reductions in codon optimality in BRCA1 can attenuate its function.

First, in addition to a strong effect of isochores, we have detected the influence of transcription-associated mutational biases (TAMB) on gene composition. Genes expressed in different tissues show diverse degrees of TAMB, with genes expressed in testis showing the greatest influence. Second, the study of tissues with no evidence of TAMB reveals a consistent set of optimal synonymous codons favored in highly expressed genes. This result exposes the consequences of natural selection on synonymous composition to increase efficiency of translation in the human lineage. Third, overall amino acid composition of proteins closely resembles tRNA abundance but there is no difference in amino acid composition in differentially expressed genes. Fourth, there is a negative relationship between expression and CDS length. Significantly, this is observed only among genes with introns, suggesting that the cause for this relationship in humans cannot be associated only with costs of amino acid biosynthesis. Fifth, we show that broadly and highly expressed genes have more, although shorter, introns. The selective advantage for having more introns in highly expressed genes is likely counterbalanced by containment of transcriptional costs and a minimum exon size for proper splicing.},

Although the resulting estimators of N, T and Vk• are upwardly biased for species with short adult lifespans, the estimate of Ne/N is largely unbiased because biases in T are compensated for by biases in Vk• and N. For the first time, the contrasting effects of T and Vk• on Ne and Ne/N are jointly considered with respect to d and φ. A simple function of d and α based on the assumption of constant vital rates is shown to be a robust predictor (R2=0.78) of Ne/N in an empirical data set of life tables for 63 animal and plant species with diverse life histories. Results presented here should provide important context for interpreting the surge of genetically based estimates of Ne that has been fueled by the genomics revolution.},

	abstract = {Background
Genetic variations contribute to normal phenotypic differences as well as diseases, and new sequencing technologies are greatly increasing the capacity to identify these variations. Given the large number of variations now being discovered, computational methods to prioritize the functional importance of genetic variations are of growing interest. Thus far, the focus of computational tools has been mainly on the prediction of the effects of amino acid changing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and little attention has been paid to indels or nonsense SNPs that result in premature stop codons.

Results
We propose computational methods to rank insertion-deletion mutations in the coding as well as non-coding regions and nonsense mutations. We rank these variations by measuring the extent of their effect on biological function, based on the assumption that evolutionary conservation reflects function. Using sequence data from budding yeast and human, we show that variations which that we predict to have larger effects segregate at significantly lower allele frequencies, and occur less frequently than expected by chance, indicating stronger purifying selection. Furthermore, we find that insertions, deletions and premature stop codons associated with disease in the human have significantly larger predicted effects than those not associated with disease. Interestingly, the large-effect mutations associated with disease show a similar distribution of predicted effects to that expected for completely random mutations.

Conclusions
This demonstrates that the evolutionary conservation context of the sequences that harbour insertions, deletions and nonsense mutations can be used to predict and rank the effects of the mutations.},

	abstract = {Accurate DNA replication is crucial for cell survival and the maintenance of genome stability. Cells have developed mechanisms to cope with the frequent genotoxic injuries that arise from both endogenous and environmental sources. Lesions encountered during DNA replication are often tolerated by post-replication repair mechanisms that prevent replication fork collapse and avert the formation of DNA double strand breaks. There are two predominant post-replication repair pathways, trans-lesion synthesis (TLS) and template switching (TS). TLS is a DNA damage-tolerant and low-fidelity mode of DNA synthesis that utilizes specialized ‘Y-family’ DNA polymerases to replicate damaged templates. TS, however, is an error-free ‘DNA damage avoidance’ mode of DNA synthesis that uses a newly synthesized sister chromatid as a template in lieu of the damaged parent strand. Both TLS and TS pathways are tightly controlled signaling cascades that integrate DNA synthesis with the overall DNA damage response and are thus crucial for genome stability. This review will cover the current knowledge of the primary mediators of post-replication repair and how they are regulated in the cell.},

We have conducted a computational analysis of 5,669 genes (17,208 sequences) from species representing major groups of placental mammals to characterize the extent of mutation rate differences among genes in a genome and among diverse mammalian lineages. We find that mutation rate is approximately constant per year and largely similar among genes. Similarity of mutation rates among lineages with vastly different generation lengths and physiological attributes points to a much greater contribution of replication-independent mutational processes to the overall mutation rate. Our results suggest that the average mammalian genome mutation rate is 2.2 × 10−9 per base pair per year, which provides further opportunities for estimating species and population divergence times by using molecular clocks.},

Similarly, we analyse genome evolution in bacteria from the genome sequences of input and output strains sequentially taken after experimental infection of a rhesus macaque. The estimated mutation rate reveals a mutation burst during the acute infection phase that is over 10 times faster than the mutation rate during chronic infection, and orders of magnitude faster than mutation rates in any other bacteria. The elevated frequency of mutations in outer membrane protein genes suggests that the mutation burst facilitates rapid host adaptation of the bacteria.},

The development of a detection system for mutations in H. pylori genes might therefore help us to develop a better understanding of its mutability, and in this way help us to develop plans for investigating the relationship between its genomic variability and the pathogenesis of various gastric and duodenal diseases associated with the long-term H. pylori infections. We have therefore begun a study of H. pylori mutability using the endogenous rpsL gene as a marker. Spontaneous mutant frequencies were measured and compared among H. pylori strains, after incubation on plates containing 50 microg/ml of streptomycin for 10 days as a selection procedure. The rpsL gene of each streptomycin-resistant (Str(r)) mutant was amplified by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) and sequenced. All of the mutations we characterized were localized at codons 43 or 88 of the rpsL gene and were base transitions from A to G, replacing lysine with arginine. This is in contrast to the spontaneous Str(r) mutants isolated from Escherichia coli, which resulted from either A to G transitions at lysine codons 42 and 87, or A to T or C transversions at lysine codon 42. The spontaneous mutant frequencies of the rpsL gene in H. pylori were of the order of 10(-9), and there were significant differences in spontaneous mutant frequencies among the strains tested. This mutation detection system might be of value in screening clinical isolates for H. pylori mutator phenotypes.},

In the past, it was difficult to study this problem because our lifetime is too short to observe the entire process of speciation. In recent years, however, molecular and genomic techniques have been developed for identifying and studying the genes involved in speciation. Using these techniques, many investigators have already obtained new findings. At present, however, the results obtained are complex and quite confusing. We have therefore attempted to understand these findings coherently with a historical perspective and clarify the roles of mutation and natural selection in speciation. We have first indicated that the root of the currently burgeoning field of plant genomics goes back to Hugo de Vries, who proposed the mutation theory of evolution more than a century ago and that he unknowingly found the importance of polyploidy and chromosomal rearrangements in plant speciation. We have then shown that the currently popular Dobzhansky–Muller model of evolution of reproductive isolation is only one of many possible mechanisms. Some of them are Oka’s model of duplicate gene mutations, multiallelic speciation, mutation-rescue model, segregation-distorter gene model, heterochromatin-associated speciation, single-locus model, etc. The occurrence of speciation also depends on the reproductive system, population size, bottleneck effects, and environmental factors, such as temperature and day length. Some authors emphasized the importance of natural selection to speed up speciation, but mutation is crucial in speciation because reproductive barriers cannot be generated without mutations.},

We found that 23\% of genes within the reference Chiifu‐401‐42 genome harbored TIPs. TIPs tended to have large transcriptional effects, including modifying gene expression levels and altering gene structure by introducing new introns. Among 524 diverse accessions, TIPs broadly influenced genes related to traits and acted a crucial role in the domestication of B. rapa morphotypes. As examples, four specific TIP‐containing genes were found to be candidates that potentially involved in various climatic conditions, promoting the formation of diverse vegetable crops in B. rapa. Our work reveals the hitherto hidden TIPs implicated in agronomic traits and highlights their widespread utility in studies of crop domestication.},

The cichlid fish family provides a notable example of such variation, with many slowly speciating lineages as well as several exceptionally large and rapid radiations12. Here, by reconstructing a large phylogeny of all currently described cichlid species, we show that explosive speciation is solely concentrated in species flocks of several large young lakes. Increases in the speciation rate are associated with the absence of top predators; however, this does not sufficiently explain explosive speciation. Across lake radiations, we observe a positive relationship between the speciation rate and enrichment of large insertion or deletion polymorphisms. Assembly of 100 cichlid genomes within the most rapidly speciating cichlid radiation, which is found in Lake Victoria, reveals exceptional ‘genomic potential’—hundreds of ancient haplotypes bear insertion or deletion polymorphisms, many of which are associated with specific ecologies and shared with ecologically similar species from other older radiations elsewhere in Africa. Network analysis reveals fundamentally non-treelike evolution through recombining old haplotypes, and the origins of ecological guilds are concentrated early in the radiation. Our results suggest that the combination of ecological opportunity, sexual selection and exceptional genomic potential is the key to understanding explosive adaptive radiation.},

The number of INDELs in human genomes is second only to the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and, in terms of base pairs of variation, INDELs cause similar levels of variation as SNPs.

	abstract = {Short insertions and deletions (indels) are the second most abundant form of human genetic variation, but our understanding of their origins and functional effects lags behind that of other types of variants. Using population-scale sequencing, we have identified a high-quality set of 1.6 million indels from 179 individuals representing three diverse human populations. We show that rates of indel mutagenesis are highly heterogeneous, with 43\%–48\% of indels occurring in 4.03\% of the genome, whereas in the remaining 96\% their prevalence is 16 times lower than SNPs. Polymerase slippage can explain upwards of three-fourths of all indels, with the remainder being mostly simple deletions in complex sequence. However, insertions do occur and are significantly associated with pseudo-palindromic sequence features compatible with the fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS) mechanism more commonly associated with large structural variations. We introduce a quantitative model of polymerase slippage, which enables us to identify indel-hypermutagenic protein-coding genes, some of which are associated with recurrent mutations leading to disease. Accounting for mutational rate heterogeneity due to sequence context, we find that indels across functional sequence are generally subject to stronger purifying selection than SNPs. We find that indel length modulates selection strength, and that indels affecting multiple functionally constrained nucleotides undergo stronger purifying selection. We further find that indels are enriched in associations with gene expression and find evidence for a contribution of nonsense-mediated decay. Finally, we show that indels can be integrated in existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS); although we do not find direct evidence that potentially causal protein-coding indels are enriched with associations to known disease-associated SNPs, our findings suggest that the causal variant underlying some of these associations may be indels.},

It was produced from ∼32 million random DNA fragments, sequenced by Sanger dideoxy technology and assembled into 4,528 scaffolds, comprising 2,810 million bases (Mb) of contiguous sequence with approximately 7.5-fold coverage for any given region. We developed a modified version of the Celera assembler to facilitate the identification and comparison of alternate alleles within this individual diploid genome. Comparison of this genome and the National Center for Biotechnology Information human reference assembly revealed more than 4.1 million DNA variants, encompassing 12.3 Mb. These variants (of which 1,288,319 were novel) included 3,213,401 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 53,823 block substitutions (2–206 bp), 292,102 heterozygous insertion/deletion events (indels)(1–571 bp), 559,473 homozygous indels (1–82,711 bp), 90 inversions, as well as numerous segmental duplications and copy number variation regions. Non-SNP DNA variation accounts for 22\% of all events identified in the donor, however they involve 74\% of all variant bases. This suggests an important role for non-SNP genetic alterations in defining the diploid genome structure. Moreover, 44\% of genes were heterozygous for one or more variants. Using a novel haplotype assembly strategy, we were able to span 1.5 Gb of genome sequence in segments {\textgreater}200 kb, providing further precision to the diploid nature of the genome.

These disorders provide many examples of the effects that such repeats can have on many biological processes. While repeats in the coding sequence can result in the generation of toxic or malfunctioning proteins, noncoding repeats can also have significant effects including the generation of chromosome fragility, the silencing of the genes in which they are located, the modulation of transcription and translation, and the sequestering of proteins involved in processes such as splicing and cell architecture.},

Here we report a new method that uses SNP genotype data from parent-offspring trios to identify polymorphic deletions. We applied this method to data from the International HapMap Project5 to produce the first high-resolution population surveys of deletion polymorphism. Approximately 100 of these deletions have been experimentally validated using comparative genome hybridization on tiling-resolution oligonucleotide microarrays. Our analysis identifies a total of 586 distinct regions that harbor deletion polymorphisms in one or more of the families. Notably, we estimate that typical individuals are hemizygous for roughly 30–50 deletions larger than 5 kb, totaling around 550–750 kb of euchromatic sequence across their genomes. The detected deletions span a total of 267 known and predicted genes. Overall, however, the deleted regions are relatively gene-poor, consistent with the action of purifying selection against deletions. Deletion polymorphisms may well have an important role in the genetics of complex traits; however, they are not directly observed in most current gene mapping studies. Our new method will permit the identification of deletion polymorphisms in high-density SNP surveys of trio or other family data.},

In this report, we describe an approach that can detect indels in the heterozygous state and can comprehensively identify indels in the target sequence. Using this approach, we identified 2393 indels in a set of 330 candidate genes, i.e. an average of seven indels per gene with about two indels per gene being common (minor allele frequency ≥0.1). We compared the population genetic characteristics of indels with substitutions in this data. Our data supported the findings that deletions occur more frequently in the human genome. 5 ′ -UTR and coding regions of the genes showed a significantly lower diversity for indels compared with other regions, suggesting differences in effects of selection on indels and substitutions. Sequence diversity and pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) findings of the different populations were similar to earlier results and included a greater skew towards low-frequency variants and a faster rate of LD decay in the African-descent population compared with the non-African populations. Within populations, the allele frequency spectra and LD-decay profiles for indels were similar to substitutions. Overall, the findings suggest that, although the mechanisms giving rise to indels may be different from those causing substitutions, the evolutionary histories of indels and substitutions are similar, and that indels can play a valuable role in association studies and marker selection strategies.},

	abstract = {Background
For decades, linkage mapping has been one of the most powerful and widely used approaches for elucidating the genetic architecture of phenotypic traits of medical, agricultural and evolutionary importance. However, successful mapping of Mendelian and quantitative phenotypic traits depends critically on the availability of fast and preferably high-throughput genotyping platforms. Several array-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping platforms have been developed for genetic model organisms during recent years but most of these methods become prohibitively expensive for screening large numbers of individuals. Therefore, inexpensive, simple and flexible genotyping solutions that enable rapid screening of intermediate numbers of loci ({\textasciitilde}75-300) in hundreds to thousands of individuals are still needed for QTL mapping applications in a broad range of organisms.

Results
Here we describe the discovery of and application of insertion-deletion (INDEL) polymorphisms for cost-efficient medium throughput genotyping that enables analysis of {\textgreater}75 loci in a single automated sequencer electrophoresis column with standard laboratory equipment. Genotyping of INDELs requires low start-up costs, includes few standard sample handling steps and is applicable to a broad range of species for which expressed sequence tag (EST) collections are available. As a proof of principle, we generated a partial INDEL linkage map in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rapidly identified a number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting early life-history traits that are expected to have important fitness consequences in the natural environment.

Conclusions
The INDEL genotyping enabled fast coarse-mapping of chromosomal regions containing QTL, thus providing an efficient means for characterization of genetic architecture in multiple crosses and large pedigrees. This enables not only the discovery of larger number of QTLs with relatively smaller phenotypic effect but also provides a cost-effective means for evaluation of the frequency of segregating QTLs in outbred populations which is important for further understanding how genetic variation underlying phenotypic traits is maintained in the wild.},

Cancer cells have general as well as cancer type-specific and subtype-specific alterations in the splicing process that can have prognostic value and contribute to every hallmark of cancer progression, including cancer immune responses. These splicing alterations are often linked to the occurrence of cancer driver mutations in genes encoding either core components or regulators of the splicing machinery. Of therapeutic relevance, the transcriptomic landscape of cancer cells makes them particularly vulnerable to pharmacological inhibition of splicing. Small-molecule splicing modulators are currently in clinical trials and, in addition to splice site-switching antisense oligonucleotides, offer the promise of novel and personalized approaches to cancer treatment.},

Different species have consistent and characteristic codon biases. Codon bias varies not only with species, family or group within kingdom, but also between the genes within an organism. Codon usage bias has evolved through mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift in various organisms. Genome composition, GC content, expression level and length of genes, position and context of codons in the genes, recombination rates, mRNA folding, and tRNA abundance and interactions are some factors influencing codon bias. The factors shaping codon bias may also be involved in evolution of the universal genetic code. Codon-usage bias is critical factor determining gene expression and cellular function by influencing diverse processes such as RNA processing, protein translation and protein folding. Codon usage bias reflects the origin, mutation patterns and evolution of the species or genes. Investigations of codon bias patterns in genomes can reveal phylogenetic relationships between organisms, horizontal gene transfers, molecular evolution of genes and identify selective forces that drive their evolution. Most important application of codon bias analysis is in the design of transgenes, to increase gene expression levels through codon optimization, for development of transgenic crops.

	abstract = {Alternative splicing is a tightly regulated process whereby non-coding sequences of pre-mRNA are removed and protein-coding segments are assembled in diverse combinations, ultimately giving rise to proteins with distinct or even opposing functions. In the past decade, whole genome/transcriptome sequencing studies revealed the high complexity of splicing regulation, which occurs co-transcriptionally and is influenced by chromatin status and mRNA modifications. Consequently, splicing profiles of both healthy and malignant cells display high diversity and alternative splicing was shown to be widely deregulated in multiple cancer types. In particular, mutations in pre-mRNA regulatory sequences, splicing regulators and chromatin modifiers, as well as differential expression of splicing factors are important contributors to cancer pathogenesis. It has become clear that these aberrations contribute to many facets of cancer, including oncogenic transformation, cancer progression, response to anticancer drug treatment as well as resistance to therapy. In this respect, alternative splicing was shown to perturb the expression a broad spectrum of relevant genes involved in drug uptake/metabolism (i.e. SLC29A1, dCK, FPGS, and TP), activation of nuclear receptor pathways (i.e. GR, AR), regulation of apoptosis (i.e. MCL1, BCL-X, and FAS) and modulation of response to immunotherapy (CD19). Furthermore, aberrant splicing constitutes an important source of novel cancer biomarkers and the spliceosome machinery represents an attractive target for a novel and rapidly expanding class of therapeutic agents. Small molecule inhibitors targeting SF3B1 or splice factor kinases were highly cytotoxic against a wide range of cancer models, including drug-resistant cells. Importantly, these effects are enhanced in specific cancer subsets, such as splicing factor-mutated and c-MYC-driven tumors. Furthermore, pre-clinical studies report synergistic effects of spliceosome modulators in combination with conventional antitumor agents. These strategies based on the use of low dose splicing modulators could shift the therapeutic window towards decreased toxicity in healthy tissues. Here we provide an extensive overview of the latest findings in the field of regulation of splicing in cancer, including molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells harness alternative splicing to drive oncogenesis and evade anticancer drug treatment as well as splicing-based vulnerabilities that can provide novel treatment opportunities. Furthermore, we discuss current challenges arising from genome-wide detection and prediction methods of aberrant splicing, as well as unravelling functional relevance of the plethora of cancer-related splicing alterations.},

	abstract = {Objective
Alternative splicing can generate various structural and functional protein isoforms. Recently, accumulating evidence shows a relationship between alternative splicing and cancer. Cancer is a complex and chronic disease that involves malignant transformation. In this review, we consider alternative splicing events in relation to the hallmarks of cancer cells, and discuss current therapies to treat cancer-related to alternative splicing.

Data sources
Data cited in this article are from the PubMed and Embase database, primarily focusing on research published from 2000 to 2018.

Study selection
Articles were selected with the search terms “alternative splicing,” “cancer cell,” “tumor microenvironment,” and “therapy.”

Results
Alternative splicing plays an important role in tumorigenesis, development, and escape from cell death. Taking this trait of cancer cells into consideration will allow more definite diagnoses of cancer, and allow the development of more effective medicines to intervene in cancer that could focus on controlling alternative splicing or competitively binding to the final products.

Conclusions
Alternative splicing is common in cancer cells. Consideration of alternative splicing may allow different strategies for cancer therapy or the identification of novel biomarkers for cancer diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Modern transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are composed of {\textasciitilde}76 nucleotides and play an important role as “adaptor” molecules that mediate the translation of information from messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Many studies suggest that the contemporary full-length tRNA was formed by the ligation of half-sized hairpin-like RNAs. A minihelix (a coaxial stack of the acceptor stem on the T-stem of tRNA) can function both in aminoacylation by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and in peptide bond formation on the ribosome, indicating that it may be a vestige of the ancestral tRNA. The universal CCA-3′ terminus of tRNA is also a typical characteristic of the molecule. “Why CCA?” is the fundamental unanswered question, but several findings give a comprehensive picture of its origin. Here, the origins and early evolution of tRNA are discussed in terms of various perspectives, including nucleotide ligation, chiral selectivity of amino acids, genetic code evolution, and the organization of the ribosomal peptidyl transferase center (PTC). The proto-tRNA molecules may have evolved not only as adaptors but also as contributors to the composition of the ribosome.},

	abstract = {A new explanation for the emergence of heavy (GC-rich) isochores is proposed, based on the study of thermostability, bendability, ability to B-Z transition and curvature of the DNA helix. The absolute values of thermostability, bendability and ability to B-Z transition correlated positively with GC content, whereas curvature correlated negatively. The relative values of these parameters were determined as compared to randomized sequences. In genes and intergenic spacers of warm-blooded animals, both the relative bendability and ability to B-Z transition increased with elevation of GC content, whereas the relative thermostability and curvature decreased. The usage of synonymous codons in GC-rich genes was also found to augment bendability and ability to B-Z transition and to reduce thermostability of DNA (as compared to synonymous codons with the same GC content). The analysis of transposable elements (Alu and B2 repeats in the human and mouse) showed that the level of their divergence from the consensus sequence positively correlated with relative bendability and ability to B-Z transition and negatively with relative thermostability. The bendability and ability to B-Z transition are known to relate to open chromatin and active transcription, whereas curvature facilitates chromatin condensation. Because heavy isochores are known to be gene-rich and show a high level of transcription, it is suggested here that isochores arose not as an adaptation to elevated temperature but because of a certain grade of general organization and correspondingly advanced level of genomic organization, reflected in genome structuring, with physical properties of DNA in the gene-rich regions being optimized for active transcription and in the gene-poor regions for chromatin condensation ('transcription/grade' concept).},

	abstract = {There is massive variation in intron numbers across eukaryotic genomes, yet the major drivers of intron content during evolution remain elusive. Rapid intron loss and gain in some lineages contrast with long-term evolutionary stasis in others. Episodic intron gain could be explained by recently discovered specialized transposons called Introners, but so far Introners are only known from a handful of species. Here, we performed a systematic search across 3,325 eukaryotic genomes and identified 27,563 Introner-derived introns in 175 genomes (5.2\%). Species with Introners span remarkable phylogenetic diversity, from animals to basal protists, representing lineages whose last common ancestor dates to over 1.7 billion years ago. Aquatic organisms were 6.5 times more likely to contain Introners than terrestrial organisms. Introners exhibit mechanistic diversity but most are consistent with DNA transposition, indicating that Introners have evolved convergently hundreds of times from nonautonomous transposable elements. Transposable elements and aquatic taxa are associated with high rates of horizontal gene transfer, suggesting that this combination of factors may explain the punctuated and biased diversity of species containing Introners. More generally, our data suggest that Introners may explain the episodic nature of intron gain across the eukaryotic tree of life. These results illuminate the major source of ongoing intron creation in eukaryotic genomes.},

Next, we discuss the main scenarios proposed for the origin and proliferation of spliceosomal introns, an event intimately linked to eukaryogenesis. We then summarize the evidence that suggests that the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) had remarkably high intron densities and many associated characteristics resembling modern intron-rich genomes. From this intron-rich LECA, the different eukaryotic lineages have taken very distinct evolutionary paths leading to profoundly diverged modern genome structures. Finally, we discuss the origins of alternative splicing and the qualitative differences in alternative splicing forms and functions across lineages., Spliceosomal introns are ubiquitous in nearly every eukaryotic genome. The α-proteobacterial ancestor of mitochondria may have possessed group II self-splicing introns that gave rise to these spliceosomal introns.},

Genetic studies revealed that Dscam, Dock and Pak, a serine/threonine kinase, act together to direct pathfinding of Bolwig's nerve, containing a subclass of sensory axons, to an intermediate target in the embryo. Dscam also is required for the formation of axon pathways in the embryonic central nervous system. cDNA and genomic analyses reveal the existence of multiple forms of Dscam with a conserved architecture containing variable Ig and transmembrane domains. Alternative splicing can potentially generate more than 38,000 Dscam isoforms. This molecular diversity may contribute to the specificity of neuronal connectivity.},

	abstract = {As shown in the accompanying paper, μ chains of the membrane-bound (μm) and secreted (μs) forms of IgM are encoded by two species of mRNA. Cloned cDNAs produced from the two μ mRNAs of M104E mouse myeloma tumors differ only at their 3′ ends, which encode either the μm or μs C terminus. In this paper, we show that both μm and μs mRNAs are produced from transcripts of a single μ gene. The last 187 nucleotides of μs mRNA are derived from DNA contiguous with the 3′ end of the sequence encoding the Cμ4 domain. The μm cDNA clone does not include these 187 nucleotides, but instead contains 392 nucleotides derived from two exons located 1850 bp 3′ to the Cμ4 sequence. Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences show that in μm mRNA, an RNA splice of 1850 nucleotides joins a site in the coding sequence at the end of Cμ4 with a site at the beginning of the first membrane-specific exon. A second RNA splice of 118 nucleotides joins sequences transcribed from the first and second membrane-specific exons. The differences observed between μm and μs cDNAs suggest that developmental control of the site at which poly(A) is added to transcripts of the μ gene determines the relative levels of μm or μs chain synthesis. We discuss possible models for the control of μ gene transcripts and the significance of this form of developmentally regulated RNA processing for the evolution of eucaryotic “split genes.”},

Many of these small nuclear RNA (snRNA) species, which range in size from about 90 to 220 nucleotides, have been well-characterised biochemically3–6, and some sequenced7,8. However, their function has remained obscure. The most abundant snRNA species exist as a closely related set of RNA–protein complexes called small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs)9. snRNPs are the antigens recognised by antibodies from some patients with lupus erythematosus (LE), an autoimmune rheumatic disease10,11. Anti-RNP antibodies from lupus sera selectively precipitate snRNP species containing Ula7 and Ulb9 RNAs from mouse Ehrlich ascites cell nuclei, whereas anti-Sm antibodies bind these snRNPs and four others containing U2 (ref. 8), U4, US and U6 (ref. 9) RNAs. Both antibody systems precipitate the same seven prominent nuclear proteins (molecular weight 12,000–32,000). All molecules of the snRNAs U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 appear to exist in the form of antigenic snRNPs9. The particles sediment at about 10S and each probably contains a single snRNA molecule. Indirect immunofluorescence studies (refs 12, 13, and unpublished observations) using anti-RNP and anti-Sm sera confirm the nuclear (but non-nucleolar) location of the antigenic snRNPs. Here we present several lines of evidence that suggest a direct involvement of snRNPs in the splicing of hnRNA. Most intriguing is the observation that the nucleotide sequence at the 5′ end of U1 RNA exhibits extensive complementarity to those across splice junctions in hnRNA molecules.},

That sequences responsible for recognition of the 5′ splice site can be relocated within the splicing substrate itself reinforces the similarity between group II self-splicing and spliceosome-mediated pre-mRNA splicing.},

However, recent advances in sequencing technology, computational algorithms and other assays have enabled a more detailed look at poly(A) tail length genome-wide throughout many developmental stages and organisms. With the help of these advances, our understanding of poly(A) tail length has evolved over the past five years with the recognition that highly expressed genes can have short poly(A) tails and the elucidation of seemingly contradictory roles for poly(A) binding protein (PABP) in facilitating both protection and deadenylation.},

	abstract = {Based on the above mechanisms of mRNA degradation, an integrated model of mRNA turnover can be proposed (Figure 1). In this model, all polyadenylated mRNAs would be degraded by the deadenylation-dependent pathway at some rate. In addition to this default pathway, another layer of complexity would come from degradation mechanisms specific to individual mRNAs or to classes of mRNAs. Such mRNA-specific mechanisms would include sequence-specific endonuclease cleavage and deadenylation-independent decapping. Thus, the overall decay rate of an individual transcript will be a function of its susceptibility to these turnover pathways. In addition, cis-acting sequences that specify mRNA decay rate, as well as regulatory inputs that control mRNA turnover, are likely to affect all the steps of these decay pathways. One important goal in future work will be to identify the gene products that are responsible for the nucleolytic events in these pathways and to delineate how specific mRNA features act to affect the function of these degradative activities. The identification of distinct mRNA decay pathways should allow, genetic and biochemical approaches that can be designed to identify these gene products. A second important goal is to understand the nature of the interaction between the 5' and 3' termini, which may also be critical for efficient translation.},

We have begun to explore the mechanism by which the TFIID–Inr interaction leads to functional synergy between TATA and Inr elements during both basal and activated transcription. In DNase I footprinting assays, GAL4–VP16 recruited TFIID–TFIIA to core promoters containing either a TATA box, an Inr, or both TATA and Inr elements, with synergistic interactions apparent on the TATA–Inr promoter. Appropriate spacing between the two elements was essential for the synergistic binding. Despite the sequence-specific TFIID–Inr interactions, gel shift experiments revealed that TFIID alone possesses similar affinities for the TATA–Inr and TATA promoters. Interestingly, however, recombinant TFIIA strongly and selectively enhanced TFIID binding to the TATA–Inr promoter, with little effect on binding to the TATA promoter. Studies of the natural adenovirus major late promoter confirmed these findings, despite the existence of specific but nonfunctional TFIID interactions downstream of the Inr in that promoter. These results suggest that a TFIIA-induced conformational change is essential for the sequence-specific TFIID–Inr interaction to occur with sufficient affinity to support the functional synergism between TATA and Inr elements.},

The expression of the genes for each of the five histone proteins is tightly regulated with respect to the cell cycle, the developmental stage, and the expression of the other histone genes. In several species studied, the synthesis of all five proteins occurs exclusively in concert with the DNA synthetic phase of the cell cycle (Robbins and Borun 1967; Kedes et al. 1969; Perry and Kelley 1973); the four histones of the nucleosome core are found in equimolar amounts, whereas H1 protein is found in less than molar quantity (for review, see Kornberg 1974). Variant histone proteins associated with specific developmental stages have been observed (Cohen et al. 1975; Arceci et al. 1976; Newrock and Cohen, this volume), indicating that there must be genes for these variant proteins which are differentially expressed according to precise developmental programs.

Basic parameters commonly used to describe genomes including length, weight and relative guanine-cytosine (GC) content are widely cited in absence of a primary source. By using updated data and original software we determined these values to the best of our knowledge as standard reference for the whole human nuclear genome, for each chromosome and for mitochondrial DNA. We also devised a method to calculate the relative GC content in the whole messenger RNA sequence set and in transcriptomes by multiplying the GC content of each gene by its mean expression level.

Results
The male nuclear diploid genome extends for 6.27 Gigabase pairs (Gbp), is 205.00 cm (cm) long and weighs 6.41 picograms (pg). Female values are 6.37 Gbp, 208.23 cm, 6.51 pg. The individual variability and the implication for the DNA informational density in terms of bits/volume were discussed. The genomic GC content is 40.9\%. Following analysis in different transcriptomes and species, we showed that the greatest deviation was observed in the pathological condition analysed (trisomy 21 leukaemic cells) and in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results may represent a solid basis for further investigation on human structural and functional genomics while also providing a framework for other genome comparative analysis.

	abstract = {Telomeres play a central role in cell fate and aging by adjusting the cellular response to stress and growth stimulation on the basis of previous cell divisions and DNA damage. At least a few hundred nucleotides of telomere repeats must “cap” each chromosome end to avoid activation of DNA repair pathways. Repair of critically short or “uncapped” telomeres by telomerase or recombination is limited in most somatic cells and apoptosis or cellular senescence is triggered when too many “uncapped” telomeres accumulate. The chance of the latter increases as the average telomere length decreases. The average telomere length is set and maintained in cells of the germline which typically express high levels of telomerase. In somatic cells, telomere length is very heterogeneous but typically declines with age, posing a barrier to tumor growth but also contributing to loss of cells with age. Loss of (stem) cells via telomere attrition provides strong selection for abnormal and malignant cells, a process facilitated by the genome instability and aneuploidy triggered by dysfunctional telomeres. The crucial role of telomeres in cell turnover and aging is highlighted by patients with 50\% of normal telomerase levels resulting from a mutation in one of the telomerase genes. Short telomeres in such patients are implicated in a variety of disorders including dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia, pulmonary fibrosis, and cancer. Here the role of telomeres and telomerase in human aging and aging-associated diseases is reviewed.},

The single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (TTGGGG)4 and TGTGTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGTGGG, consisting of the Tetrahymena and yeast telomeric sequences respectively, each functioned as primers for elongation, while (CCCCAA)4 and two nontelomeric sequence DNA oligomers did not. Efficient synthesis of the TTGGGG repeats depended only on addition of micromolar concentrations of oligomer primer, dGTP, and dTTP to the extract. The activity was sensitive to heat and proteinase K treatment. The repeat addition was independent of both endogenous Tetrahymena DNA and the endogenous α-type DNA polymerase; and a greater elongation activity was present during macronuclear development, when a large number of telomeres are formed and replicated, than during vegetative cell growth. We propose that the novel telomere terminal transferase is involved in the addition of telomeric repeats necessary for the replication of chromosome ends in eukaryotes.},

Here, we demonstrate that this telomeretrimming process occurs in cells of the male germline and in normal lymphocytes following mitogen-stimulated upregulation of telomerase activity. Mouse tissues also contain abundant t-circles, suggesting that telomere trimming also contributes to telomere length regulation in mice. In cancer cells and stimulated lymphocytes, the mechanism involves the XRCC3 homologous recombination (HR) protein and generates single-stranded C-rich telomeric DNA. This suggests that, in addition to the well-documented gradual telomere attrition that accompanies cellular replication, there is also a more rapid form of negative telomere length control in normal mammalian cells, which most likely involves HR-mediated removal of telomere loops in the form of t-circles. We therefore propose that this telomere trimming mechanism is an additional factor in the balance between telomere lengthening and telomere shortening in normal human germline and somatic cells that may prevent excessive lengthening by processes such as telomerase activity.},

Phylogenetic relationships of Orthonectida have remained controversial for a long time. According to recent data, they are close to Annelida, specifically to Clitellata [3-5]. Several studies have shown that parasitism can not only lead to a dramatic reduction of the body plan and morphological structures but also affect organisms at the genomic level [6, 7]. Comparative studies of parasites and closely related non-parasitic species could clarify the genome reduction degree and evolution of parasitism. Here, we report on the morphology, genome structure, and content of the smallest known Orthonectida species Intoshia variabili, inhabiting the flatworm Graffiellus croceus. This orthonectid with an extremely simplified nervous system demonstrates the smallest known genome (15.3 Mbp) and one of the lowest reported so far gene numbers (5,120 protein-coding genes) among metazoans. The genome is extremely compact, due to a significant reduction of gene number, intergenic regions, intron length, and repetitive elements. The small genome size is probably a result of extreme genome reduction due to their parasitic lifestyle, as well as of simplification and miniaturization of the free-living stages. Our data could provide further insights into the evolution of parasitism and could help to define a minimal bilaterian gene set.},

This function has been shown to regulate diverse protein features, including protein complex formation or posttranslational modifications, but is also expected to alter protein conformations. Therefore, 3′ UTR-mediated information transfer can regulate protein features that are not encoded in the amino acid sequence. This review summarizes both 3′ UTR functions—the regulation of mRNA and protein-based processes—and highlights how each 3′ UTR function was discovered with a focus on experimental approaches used and the concepts that were learned.

	abstract = {Lungfishes belong to lobe-fined fish (Sarcopterygii) that, in the Devonian period, ‘conquered’ the land and ultimately gave rise to all land vertebrates, including humans1–3. Here we determine the chromosome-quality genome of the Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri), which is known to have the largest genome of any animal. The vast size of this genome, which is about 14× larger than that of humans, is attributable mostly to huge intergenic regions and introns with high repeat content (around 90\%), the components of which resemble those of tetrapods (comprising mainly long interspersed nuclear elements) more than they do those of ray-finned fish. The lungfish genome continues to expand independently (its transposable elements are still active), through mechanisms different to those of the enormous genomes of salamanders. The 17 fully assembled lungfish macrochromosomes maintain synteny to other vertebrate chromosomes, and all microchromosomes maintain conserved ancient homology with the ancestral vertebrate karyotype. Our phylogenomic analyses confirm previous reports that lungfish occupy a key evolutionary position as the closest living relatives to tetrapods4,5, underscoring the importance of lungfish for understanding innovations associated with terrestrialization. Lungfish preadaptations to living on land include the gain of limb-like expression in developmental genes such as hoxc13 and sall1 in their lobed fins. Increased rates of evolution and the duplication of genes associated with obligate air-breathing, such as lung surfactants and the expansion of odorant receptor gene families (which encode proteins involved in detecting airborne odours), contribute to the tetrapod-like biology of lungfishes. These findings advance our understanding of this major transition during vertebrate evolution.},

In this Perspective, we provide a contemporary, quantitative overview of animal genome sequencing. We identified the best available genome assemblies in GenBank, the world’s most extensive genetic database, for 3,278 unique animal species across 24 phyla. We assessed taxonomic representation, assembly quality, and annotation status for major clades. We show that while tremendous taxonomic progress has occurred, stark disparities in genomic representation exist, highlighted by a systemic overrepresentation of vertebrates and underrepresentation of arthropods. In terms of assembly quality, long-read sequencing has dramatically improved contiguity, whereas gene annotations are available for just 34.3\% of taxa. Furthermore, we show that animal genome science has diversified in recent years with an ever-expanding pool of researchers participating. However, the field still appears to be dominated by institutions in the Global North, which have been listed as the submitting institution for 77\% of all assemblies. We conclude by offering recommendations for improving genomic resource availability and research value while also broadening global representation.},

The first parameter correlates with genome GC content, and the second parameter correlates with context-dependent nucleotide bias. Both of these parameters may be calculated from intergenic sequences. Therefore, genome-wide codon bias in eubacteria and archaea may be predicted from intergenic sequences that are not translated. When these two parameters are calculated for genes from nonmammalian eukaryotic organisms, genes from the same organism again have similar values, and genome-wide codon bias may also be predicted from intergenic sequences. In mammals, genes from the same organism are similar only in the second parameter, because GC content varies widely among isochores. Our results suggest that, in general, genome-wide codon bias is determined primarily by mutational processes that act throughout the genome, and only secondarily by selective forces acting on translated sequences.},

In Escherichia coli, CGA/U/C are all read solely by tRNAICGArg. CGU and CGC are very common codons, but CGA is very rare. Three independent in vivo assays show that translation of CGA is relatively inefficient. In the first, nine tandem CGA cause a strong rho-mediated polar effect on expression of a lacZ reporter gene. The inhibition is made more extreme by a mutation in ribosomal protein S12 (rpsL), which indicates that ribosomal binding by tRNAICGArg is slow and/or unstable in the CGA cluster. The second assay, in which codons are substituted for the regulatory UGA of the RF2 frameshift, confirms that aa-tRNA selection is slow and/or unstable at CGA. In the third assay, CGA is found to be a poor 5' context for amber suppression, which suggests that an A:I base pair in the P site can interfere with translation of a codon in the A site. Two possible errors, frameshifting and premature termination by RF2, are not significant causes for inefficiency at CGA. It is concluded that the A:I pair destabilizes codon:anticodon complexes during two successive ribosomal cycles, and it is suggested that these properties contribute to the rare usage of codons read with the A:I base pair.},

Codon usage bias, the preference for certain synonymous codons, is a universal feature of all genomes examined. Synonymous codon mutations were previously thought to be silent; however, a growing body evidence now shows that codon usage regulates protein structure and gene expression through effects on co-translational protein folding, translation efficiency and accuracy, mRNA stability, and transcription. Codon usage regulates the speed of translation elongation, resulting in non-uniform ribosome decoding rates on mRNAs during translation that is adapted to co-translational protein folding process. Biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrate that codon usage plays an important role in regulating protein folding and function in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Certain protein structural types are more sensitive than others to the effects of codon usage on protein folding, and predicted intrinsically disordered domains are more prone to misfolding caused by codon usage changes than other domain types. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that gene codon usage correlates with different protein structures in diverse organisms, indicating the existence of a codon usage code for co-translational protein folding. This review focuses on recent literature on the role and mechanism of codon usage in regulating translation kinetics and co-translational protein folding.},

Low frequency effects of so-called “silent” codon changes and codon neighbor (context) effects could be measured using this assay. An advantage of this system is that translation speed is unaffected by the primary sequence of the His leader peptide. We show that the apparent speed at which ribosomes translate synonymous codons can vary substantially even for synonymous codons read by the same tRNA species. Assaying translation through codon pairs for the 5′- and 3′- side positioning of the 64 codons relative to a specific codon revealed that the codon-pair orientation significantly affected in vivo translation speed. Codon pairs with rare arginine codons and successive proline codons were among the slowest codon pairs translated in vivo.

	abstract = {The translation machinery and the genes it decodes co-evolved to achieve production throughput and accuracy. Nonetheless, translation errors are frequent, and they affect physiology and protein evolution. Mapping translation errors in proteomes and understanding their causes is hindered by lack of a proteome-wide experimental methodology. We present the ﬁrst methodology for systematic detection and quantiﬁcation of errors in entire proteomes. Following proteome mass spectrometry, we identify, in E. coli and yeast, peptides whose mass indicates speciﬁc amino acid substitutions. Most substitutions result from codon-anticodon mispairing. Errors occur at sites that evolve rapidly and that minimally affect energetic stability, indicating selection for high translation ﬁdelity. Ribosome density data show that errors occur at sites where ribosome velocity is higher, demonstrating a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Treating bacteria with an aminoglycoside antibiotic or deprivation of speciﬁc amino acids resulted in particular patterns of errors. These results reveal a mechanistic and evolutionary basis for translation ﬁdelity.},

	abstract = {Translation of protein from mRNA is a complex multi-step process that occurs at a non-uniform rate. Variability in ribosome speed along an mRNA enables refinement of the proteome and plays a critical role in protein biogenesis. Detailed single protein studies have found both tRNA abundance and mRNA secondary structure as key modulators of translation elongation rate, but recent genome-wide ribosome profiling experiments have not observed significant influence of either on translation efficiency. Here we provide evidence that this results from an inherent trade-off between these factors. We find codons pairing to high-abundance tRNAs are preferentially used in regions of high secondary structure content, while codons read by significantly less abundant tRNAs are located in lowly structured regions. By considering long stretches of high and low mRNA secondary structure in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli and comparing them to randomized-gene models and experimental expression data, we were able to distinguish clear selective pressures and increased protein expression for specific codon choices. The trade-off between secondary structure and tRNA-concentration based codon choice allows for compensation of their independent effects on translation, helping to smooth overall translational speed and reducing the chance of potentially detrimental points of excessively slow or fast ribosome movement.},

	abstract = {Although tRNAs participate in the essential function of protein translation in the cytoplasm, tRNA transcription and numerous processing steps occur in the nucleus. This subcellular separation between tRNA biogenesis and function requires that tRNAs be efficiently delivered to the cytoplasm in a step termed “primary tRNA nuclear export”. Surprisingly, tRNA nuclear-cytoplasmic traffic is not unidirectional, but, rather, movement is bidirectional. Cytoplasmic tRNAs are imported back to the nucleus by the “tRNA retrograde nuclear import” step which is conserved from budding yeast to vertebrate cells and has been hijacked by viruses, such as HIV, for nuclear import of the viral reverse transcription complex in human cells. Under appropriate environmental conditions cytoplasmic tRNAs that have been imported into the nucleus return to the cytoplasm via the 3rd nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling step termed “tRNA nuclear re-export”, that again is conserved from budding yeast to vertebrate cells. We describe the 3 steps of tRNA nuclear-cytoplasmic movements and their regulation. There are multiple tRNA nuclear export and import pathways. The different tRNA nuclear exporters appear to possess substrate specificity leading to the tantalizing possibility that the cellular proteome may be regulated at the level of tRNA nuclear export. Moreover, in some organisms, such as budding yeast, the pre-tRNA splicing heterotetrameric endonuclease (SEN), which removes introns from pre-tRNAs, resides on the cytoplasmic surface of the mitochondria. Therefore, we also describe the localization of the SEN complex to mitochondria and splicing of pre-tRNA on mitochondria, which occurs prior to the participation of tRNAs in protein translation.

However, this simplistic explanation underestimates the importance of nucleotide modifications in the decoding process. Using a system in which only near-cognate tRNAs can decode a specific codon, we investigated the role of six modifications of the anticodon, or adjacent nucleotides, of the tRNAs specific for Tyr, Gln, Lys, Trp, Cys, and Arg in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Modifications almost systematically rendered these tRNAs able to act as near-cognate tRNAs at stop codons, even though they involve noncanonical base pairs, without markedly affecting their ability to decode cognate or near-cognate sense codons. These findings reveal an important effect of modifications to tRNA decoding with implications for understanding the flexibility of the genetic code.},

	abstract = {Cellular tRNAs appear today as a diverse population of informative macromolecules with conserved general elements ensuring essential common functions and different and distinctive features securing specific interactions and activities. Their differential expression and the variety of post-transcriptional modifications they are subject to, lead to the existence of complex repertoires of tRNA populations adjusted to defined cellular states. Despite the tRNA-coding genes redundancy in prokaryote and eukaryote genomes, it is surprising to note the absence of genes coding specific translational-active isoacceptors throughout the phylogeny. Through the analysis of different releases of tRNA databases, this review aims to provide a general summary about those “missing tRNA genes.” This absence refers to both tRNAs that are not encoded in the genome, as well as others that show critical sequence variations that would prevent their activity as canonical translation adaptor molecules. Notably, while a group of genes are universally missing, others are absent in particular kingdoms. Functional information available allows to hypothesize that the exclusion of isodecoding molecules would be linked to: 1) reduce ambiguities of signals that define the specificity of the interactions in which the tRNAs are involved; 2) ensure the adaptation of the translational apparatus to the cellular state; 3) divert particular tRNA variants from ribosomal protein synthesis to other cellular functions. This leads to consider the “missing tRNA genes” as a source of putative non-canonical tRNA functions and to broaden the concept of adapter molecules in ribosomal-dependent protein synthesis.},

Selection could be acting to maximize the speed of elongation, to minimize the costs of proofreading, or to maximize the accuracy of translation. Using several data sets, we find evidence that codon use in Escherichia coli is biased to reduce the costs of both missense and nonsense translational errors. Highly conserved sites and genes have higher codon bias than less conserved ones, and codon bias is positively correlated to gene length and production costs, both indicating selection against missense errors. Additionally, codon bias increases along the length of genes, indicating selection against nonsense errors. Doublet mutations or replacement substitutions do not explain our observations. The correlations remain when we control for expression level and for conflicting selection pressures at the start and end of genes. Considering each amino acid by itself confirms our results. We conclude that selection on synonymous codon use in E. coli is largely due to selection for translational accuracy, to reduce the costs of both missense and nonsense errors.},

Since the pioneering work of Grantham's group it has been apparent that genes from one species often share similarities in codon frequency; under the "genome hypothesis" there is a species-specific pattern to codon usage. However, it has become clear that in most species there are also considerable differences among genes. Multivariate analyses have revealed that in each species so far examined there is a single major trend in codon usage among genes, usually from highly biased to more nearly even usage of synonymous codons. Thus, to represent the codon usage pattern of an organism it is not sufficient to sum over all genes as this conceals the underlying heterogeneity. Rather, it is necessary to describe the trend among genes seen in that species. We illustrate these trends for six species where codon usage has been examined in detail, by presenting the pooled codon usage for the 10\% of genes at either end of the major trend. Closely-related organisms have similar patterns of codon usage, and so the six species in Table 1 are representative of wider groups. For example, with respect to codon usage, Salmonella typhimurium closely resembles E. coli, while all mammalian species so far examined (principally mouse, rat and cow) largely resemble humans.},

	abstract = {Most eukaryotic genes are interrupted by non-coding introns that must be accurately removed from pre-messenger RNAs to produce translatable mRNAs. Splicing is guided locally by short conserved sequences, but genes typically contain many potential splice sites, and the mechanisms specifying the correct sites remain poorly understood. In most organisms, short introns recognized by the intron definition mechanism cannot be efficiently predicted solely on the basis of sequence motifs. In multicellular eukaryotes, long introns are recognized through exon definition and most genes produce multiple mRNA variants through alternative splicing. The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway may further shape the observed sets of variants by selectively degrading those containing premature termination codons, which are frequently produced in mammals. Here we show that the tiny introns of the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia are under strong selective pressure to cause premature termination of mRNA translation in the event of intron retention, and that the same bias is observed among the short introns of plants, fungi and animals. By knocking down the two P. tetraurelia genes encoding UPF1, a protein that is crucial in NMD, we show that the intrinsic efficiency of splicing varies widely among introns and that NMD activity can significantly reduce the fraction of unspliced mRNAs. The results suggest that, independently of alternative splicing, species with large intron numbers universally rely on NMD to compensate for suboptimal splicing efficiency and accuracy.},

The experiments reporting these rates have measured several distinct errors using several methods and reporter systems. Variation in reported rates may reflect real differences in rates among the errors tested or in sensitivity of the reporter systems. To develop a more accurate understanding of the range of error rates, we developed a system to quantify the frequency of every possible misreading error at a defined codon in Escherichia coli. This system uses an essential lysine in the active site of firefly luciferase. Mutations in Lys529 result in up to a 1600-fold reduction in activity, but the phenotype varies with amino acid. We hypothesized that residual activity of some of the mutant genes might result from misreading of the mutant codons by tRNALys
UUUU, the cognate tRNA for the lysine codons, AAA and AAG. Our data validate this hypothesis and reveal details about relative missense error rates of near-cognate codons. The error rates in E. coli do, in fact, vary widely. One source of variation is the effect of competition by cognate tRNAs for the mutant codons; higher error frequencies result from lower competition from low-abundance tRNAs. We also used the system to study the effect of ribosomal protein mutations known to affect error rates and the effect of error-inducing antibiotics, finding that they affect misreading on only a subset of near-cognate codons and that their effect may be less general than previously thought.},

Recent ribosome profiling studies in yeast, however, have reached contradictory conclusions regarding the average translation rate of each codon. Some experiments have used cycloheximide (CHX) to stabilize ribosomes before measuring their positions, and these studies all counterintuitively report a weak negative correlation between the translation rate of a codon and the abundance of its cognate tRNA. In contrast, some experiments performed without CHX report strong positive correlations. To explain this contradiction, we identify unexpected patterns in ribosome density downstream of each type of codon in experiments that use CHX. These patterns are evidence that elongation continues to occur in the presence of CHX but with dramatically altered codon-specific elongation rates. The measured positions of ribosomes in these experiments therefore do not reflect the amounts of time ribosomes spend at each position in vivo. These results suggest that conclusions from experiments in yeast using CHX may need reexamination. In particular, we show that in all such experiments, codons decoded by less abundant tRNAs were in fact being translated more slowly before the addition of CHX disrupted these dynamics.},

	abstract = {In a wide variety of organisms, synonymous codons are used with different frequencies, a phenomenon known as codon bias. Population genetic studies have shown that synonymous sites are under weak selection and that codon bias is maintained by a balance between selection, mutation, and genetic drift. It appears that the major cause for selection on codon bias is that certain preferred codons are translated more accurately and/or efficiently. However, additional and sometimes maybe even contradictory selective forces appear to affect codon usage as well. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the ways in which natural selection participates in the creation and maintenance of codon bias. We also raise several open questions: (i) Is natural selection weak independently of the level of codon bias? It is possible that selection for preferred codons is weak only when codon bias approaches equilibrium and may be quite strong on genes with codon bias levels that are much lower and/or above equilibrium. (ii) What determines the identity of the major codons? (iii) How do shifts in codon bias occur? (iv) What is the exact nature of selection on codon bias? We discuss these questions in depth and offer some ideas on how they can be addressed using a combination of computational and experimental analyses.},

Similarly, Pol III occupancy of amino acid isotypes is almost invariant among transcriptionally and evolutionarily diverse tissues in mouse.

In coding regions, G + C -poor species tend to have unimodal distributions of G + C content among genes within genomes and slight 5′–3′ gradients along genes. In contrast, G + C -rich species display bimodal distributions of G + C content among genes and steep 5′–3′ decreasing gradients along genes. The causes of these peculiar patterns are still poorly understood. Within two species ( Arabidopsis thaliana and rice), each representative of one side of the continuum, we studied the consequences of intron presence on coding region and intron G + C content at different scales. By properly taking intron structure into account, we showed that, in both species, intron presence is associated with step changes in nucleotide, codon, and amino acid composition. This suggests that introns have a barrier effect structuring G + C content along genes and that previous continuous characterizations of the 5′–3′ gradients were artifactual. In external gene regions (located upstream first or downstream last introns), species-specific factors, such as GC-biased gene conversion, are shaping G + C content whereas in internal gene regions (surrounded by introns), G + C content is likely constrained to remain within a range common to both species.},

Here we present Quantitative Mature tRNA sequencing (QuantM-tRNA seq), a technique to monitor tRNA abundance and sequence variants secondary to RNA modifications. With QuantM-tRNA seq, we assess the tRNA transcriptome in mammalian tissues. We observe dramatic distinctions in isodecoder expression and known tRNA modifications between tissues. Remarkably, despite dramatic changes in tRNA isodecoder gene expression, the overall anticodon pool of each tRNA family is similar across tissues.

	abstract = {Most of the phenotypic diversity that we perceive in the natural world is directly attributable to the peculiar structure of the eukaryotic gene, which harbors numerous embellishments relative to the situation in prokaryotes. The most profound changes include introns that must be spliced out of precursor mRNAs, transcribed but untranslated leader and trailer sequences (untranslated regions), modular regulatory elements that drive patterns of gene expression, and expansive intergenic regions that harbor additional diffuse control mechanisms. Explaining the origins of these features is difficult because they each impose an intrinsic disadvantage by increasing the genic mutation rate to defective alleles. To address these issues, a general hypothesis for the emergence of eukaryotic gene structure is provided here. Extensive information on absolute population sizes, recombination rates, and mutation rates strongly supports the view that eukaryotes have reduced genetic effective population sizes relative to prokaryotes, with especially extreme reductions being the rule in multicellular lineages. The resultant increase in the power of random genetic drift appears to be sufficient to overwhelm the weak mutational disadvantages associated with most novel aspects of the eukaryotic gene, supporting the idea that most such changes are simple outcomes of semi-neutral processes rather than direct products of natural selection. However, by establishing an essentially permanent change in the population-genetic environment permissive to the genome-wide repatterning of gene structure, the eukaryotic condition also promoted a reliable resource from which natural selection could secondarily build novel forms of organismal complexity. Under this hypothesis, arguments based on molecular, cellular, and/or physiological constraints are insufficient to explain the disparities in gene, genomic, and phenotypic complexity between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.},

Furthermore, these excesses of symmetric exons appear also in those regions of eukaryotic genes that are homologous to prokaryotic genes: the ancient conserved regions.

          Mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic variation, and over the last ten years the easy availability of whole-genome sequencing has permitted direct estimation of the mutation rate for many non-model species from across the tree of life. In this meta-analysis we make a comprehensive search of the literature for mutation rate estimates in eukaryotes, identifying 138 mutation accumulation (MA) and parent-offspring (PO) sequencing studies covering 70 species. Based on these recently accumulated data, we revisit the mutation rate differences between different phylogenetic lineages and update the known relationships between mutation rate and generation time, population size, and genome size. We do this for single nucleotide mutations (SNM) in all species, and for short indels in the 29 species for which data are available. We do not find a significant difference between MA and PO in estimated mutation rates. However, we confirm that mammal and plant lineages have higher mutation rates than arthropods, and that unicellular eukaryotes have the lowest mutation rates. Generation time and genome size are each positively correlated with mutation rate, even when accounting for phylogenetic relationships. Meanwhile, indel mutation rates are also positively correlated with SNM rates and short deletions are generally more common than short insertions across all the species. However, we note that no estimates of either SNM or indel mutation rates are available for the majority of deeply-branching eukaryotic lineages—or even for most animal phyla. Even among charismatic megafauna, experimental mutation rate estimates remain unknown for reptiles and amphibia and scarce for birds and fish.},

The dominant paradigm is that the proportion of preferred codons is set by weak selection. While experimental changes in codon usage have at times shown large phenotypic effects in contrast to this paradigm, genome-wide population genetic estimates have supported the weak selection model. Here we use deep genomic population sequencing of two Drosophila melanogaster populations to measure selection on synonymous sites in a way that allowed us to estimate the prevalence of both weak and strong purifying selection. We ﬁnd that selection in favor of preferred codons ranges from weak ({\textbar}Nes{\textbar}   1) to strong ({\textbar}Nes{\textbar} . 10), with strong selection acting on 10–20\% of synonymous sites in preferred codons. While previous studies indicated that selection at synonymous sites could be strong, this is the ﬁrst study to detect and quantify strong selection speciﬁcally at the level of CUB. Further, we ﬁnd that CUB-associated polymorphism accounts for the majority of strong selection on synonymous sites, with secondary contributions of splicing (selection on alternatively spliced genes, splice junctions, and spliceosome-bound sites) and transcription factor binding. Our ﬁndings support a new model of CUB and indicate that the functional importance of CUB, as well as synonymous sites in general, have been underestimated.},

Codon usage bias (CUB), where certain codons are used more frequently than expected by chance, is a ubiquitous phenomenon and occurs across the tree of life. The dominant paradigm is that the proportion of preferred codons is set by weak selection. While experimental changes in codon usage have at times shown large phenotypic effects in contrast to this paradigm, genome-wide population genetic estimates have supported the weak selection model. Here we use deep genomic sequencing of two Drosophila melanogaster populations to measure selection on synonymous sites in a way that allowed us to estimate the prevalence of both weak and strong selection. We find that selection in favor of preferred codons ranges from weak ({\textbar}Nes{\textbar} ∼ 1) to strong ({\textbar}Nes{\textbar} {\textgreater} 10). While previous studies indicated that selection at synonymous sites could be strong, this is the first study to detect and quantify strong selection specifically at the level of CUB. We suggest that the level of CUB in the genome is determined by the proportion of synonymous sites under no, weak, and strong selection. This model challenges the standard Li-Bulmer model and explains some of the longest-standing puzzles in the field.},

	abstract = {Codon usage bias has been observed in almost all genomes and is thought to result from selection for efficient and accurate translation of highly expressed genes1–3. Codon usage is also implicated in the control of transcription, splicing and RNA structure4–6. Many genes exhibit little codon usage bias, which is thought to reflect a lack of selection for mRNA translation. Alternatively, however, non-optimal codon usage may have biological significance. The rhythmic expression and the proper function of the Neurospora FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein are essential for circadian clock function. Here we show that, unlike most genes in Neurospora, frq exhibits nonoptimal codon usage across its entire open reading frame. Optimization of frq codon usage abolishes both overt and molecular circadian rhythms. Codon optimization not only increases FRQ level but surprisingly, also results in conformational changes in FRQ protein, altered FRQ phosphorylation profile and stability, and impaired functions in the circadian feedback loops. These results indicate that non-optimal codon usage of frq is essential for its circadian clock function. Our study provides an example of how non-optimal codon usage functions to regulate protein expression and to achieve optimal protein structure and function.},

	abstract = {The degree to which codon usage can be explained by tRNA abundance in bacterial species is often inadequate, partly because differential tRNA abundance is often approximated by tRNA copy numbers. To better understand the coevolution between tRNA abundance and codon usage, we provide a better estimate of tRNA abundance by profiling tRNA mapped reads (tRNA tpm) using publicly available RNA Sequencing data. To emphasize the feasibility of our approach, we demonstrate that tRNA tpm is consistent with tRNA abundances derived from RNA fingerprinting experiments in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella enterica. Furthermore, we do not observe an appreciable reduction in tRNA sequencing efficiency due to post-transcriptional methylations in the seven bacteria studied. To determine optimal codons, we calculate codon usage in highly and lowly expressed genes determined by protein per transcript. We found that tRNA tpm is sensitive to identify more translationally optimal codons than gene copy number and early tRNA fingerprinting abundances. Additionally, tRNA tpm improves the predictive power of tRNA adaptation index over codon preference. Our results suggest that dependence of codon usage on tRNA availability is not always associated with species growth-rate. Conversely, tRNA availability is better optimized to codon usage in fast-growing than slow-growing species.},

The existing optimization methods are based on biological indexes. In this paper, we propose a novel codon optimization method based on deep learning. First, we introduce the concept of codon boxes, via which DNA sequences can be recoded into codon box sequences while ignoring the order of bases. Then, the problem of codon optimization can be converted to sequence annotation of corresponding amino acids with codon boxes. The codon optimization models for Escherichia Coli were trained by the Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory Conditional Random Field. Theoretically, deep learning is a good method to obtain the distribution characteristics of DNA. In addition to the comparison of the codon adaptation index, protein expression experiments for plasmodium falciparum candidate vaccine and polymerase acidic protein were implemented for comparison with the original sequences and the optimized sequences from Genewiz and ThermoFisher. The results show that our method for enhancing protein expression is efficient and competitive.},

In particular, genes involved in different functional categories display a distinct codon usage, which was interpreted as evidence that SCU is adaptively constrained to optimize translation efficiency in distinct cellular states. We demonstrate here that SCU is not driven by constraints on tRNA abundance, but by large-scale variation in GC-content, caused by meiotic recombination, via the non-adaptive process of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). Expression in meiotic cells is associated with a strong decrease in recombination within genes. Differences in SCU among functional categories reflect differences in levels of meiotic transcription, which is linked to variation in recombination and therefore in gBGC. Overall, the gBGC model explains 70\% of the variance in SCU among genes. We argue that the strong heterogeneity of SCU induced by gBGC in mammalian genomes precludes any optimization of the tRNA pool to the demand in codon usage.},

	abstract = {Eukaryotic gene expression is closely regulated by translation and turnover of mRNAs. Recent advances highlight the importance of translation in the control of mRNA degradation, both for aberrant and apparently normal mRNAs. During translation, the information contained in mRNAs is decoded by ribosomes, one codon at a time, and tRNAs, by specifically recognizing codons, translate the nucleotide code into amino acids. Such a decoding step does not process regularly, with various obstacles that can hinder ribosome progression, then leading to ribosome stalling or collisions. The progression of ribosomes is constantly monitored by the cell which has evolved several translation‐dependent mRNA surveillance pathways, including nonsense‐mediated decay (NMD), no‐go decay (NGD), and non‐stop decay (NSD), to degrade certain problematic mRNAs and the incomplete protein products. Recent progress in sequencing and ribosome profiling has made it possible to discover new mechanisms controlling ribosome dynamics, with numerous crosstalks between translation and mRNA decay. We discuss here various translation features critical for mRNA decay, with particular focus on current insights from the complexity of the genetic code and also the emerging role for the ribosome as a regulatory hub orchestrating mRNA decay, quality control, and stress signaling. Even if the interplay between mRNA translation and degradation is no longer to be demonstrated, a better understanding of their precise coordination is worthy of further investigation., This article is categorized under:RNA Turnover and Surveillance {\textgreater} Regulation of RNA StabilityTranslation {\textgreater} Translation RegulationRNA Interactions with Proteins and Other Molecules {\textgreater} RNA‐Protein Complexes

In contrast to the traditional view of tRNAs as ubiquitously expressed housekeeping molecules, awareness is now growing that tRNA-encoding genes display tissue-specific and cell type-specific patterns of expression, and that tRNA gene expression and function are both dynamically regulated by post-transcriptional RNA modifications. Moreover, dysregulation of tRNAs, mediated by alterations in either their abundance or function, can have deleterious consequences that contribute to several distinct human diseases, including neurological disorders and cancer. Accumulating evidence shows that reprogramming of mRNA translation through altered tRNA activity can drive pathological processes in a codon-dependent manner. This Review considers the emerging evidence in support of the precise control of functional tRNA levels as an important regulatory mechanism that coordinates mRNA translation and protein expression in physiological cell homeostasis, and highlights key examples of human diseases that are linked directly to tRNA dysregulation.},

However, the codon–anticodon co‐adaptation in humans is not completely understood, nor is its effect on tissue‐specific protein levels. Here, we first validated the accuracy of small RNA‐seq for tRNA quantification across five human cell lines. We then analyzed the tRNA abundance of more than 8,000 tumor samples from TCGA, together with their paired mRNA‐seq and proteomics data, to determine the Supply‐to‐Demand Adaptation. We thereby elucidate that the dynamic adaptation of the tRNA pool is largely related to the proliferative state across tissues. The distribution of such tRNA pools over the whole cellular translatome affects the subsequent translational efficiency, which functionally determines a condition‐specific expression program both in healthy and tumor states. Furthermore, the aberrant translational efficiency of some codons in cancer, exemplified by ProCCA and GlyGGT, is associated with poor patient survival. The regulation of these tRNA profiles is partly explained by the tRNA gene copy numbers and their promoter DNA methylation., Quantification of tRNA expression over thousands of small RNA‐seq samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas unveils the existence of tissue‐specific translational efficiencies related to proliferation.},

	abstract = {As the central dogma of molecular biology, genetic information flows from DNA through transcription into RNA followed by translation of the message into protein by transfer RNAs (tRNAs). However, mRNA translation is not always perfect, and errors in the amino acid composition may occur. Mistranslation is generally well tolerated, but once it reaches superphysiological levels, it can give rise to a plethora of diseases. The key causes of mistranslation are errors in translational decoding of the codons in mRNA. Such errors mainly derive from tRNA misdecoding and misacylation, especially when certain codon-paired tRNA species are missing. Substantial progress has recently been made with respect to the mechanistic basis of erroneous mRNA decoding as well as the resulting consequences for physiology and pathology. Here, we aim to review this progress with emphasis on viral evolution and cancer development.},

	abstract = {Genetic code redundancy allows most amino acids to be encoded by multiple codons which are non-randomly distributed along coding sequences. An accepted theory explaining the biological significance of such non-uniform codon selection is that codons are translated at different speeds. Thus, varying codon placement along a message may confer variable rates of polypeptide emergence from the ribosome, which may influence the capacity to fold towards the native state. Previous studies report conflicting results regarding whether certain codons correlate with particular structural or folding properties of the encoded protein. This is partly due to different criteria traditionally utilized for predicting translation speeds of codons, including their usage frequencies and the concentration of tRNA species capable of decoding them, which do not always correlate. Here, we developed a metric to predict organism-specific relative translation rates of codons based on the availability of tRNA decoding mechanisms: Watson-Crick, non-Watson-Crick or both types of interactions. We determine translation rates of messages by pulse-chase analyses in living E. coli cells and show that sequence engineering based on these concepts predictably modulates translation rates in a manner that is superior to codon usage frequency, occur during the elongation phase, and significantly impacts folding of the encoded polypeptide. Finally, we demonstrate that sequence harmonization based on expression host tRNA pools, designed to mimic ribosome movement of the original organism, can significantly increase the folding of the encoded polypeptide. These results illuminate how genetic code degeneracy may function to specify properties beyond amino acid encoding, including folding.},

Using recodonized GFP sequences, we show that codons decoded via G:U wobble pairing are suboptimal codons that are negatively associated to protein translation efficiency. Despite this, one third of all codons in the genome are GU wobble codons, suggesting that codon usage in P. falciparum has not been driven to maximize translation efficiency, but may have evolved as translational regulatory mechanism. Particularly, asparagine homorepeats are generally encoded by locally clustered GU wobble AAT codons, we demonstrated that this GU wobble-rich codon context is the determining factor that causes reduction of protein level. Moreover, insertion of clustered AAT codons also causes destabilization of the transcripts. Interestingly, more frequent asparagine homorepeats insertion is seen in single-exon genes, suggesting transcripts of these genes may have been programmed for rapid mRNA decay to compensate for the inefficiency of mRNA surveillance regulation on intronless genes. To our knowledge, this is the first study that addresses P. falciparum codon usage in vitro and provides new insights on translational regulation and genome evolution of this parasite.},

Individual amino acids are encoded by up to six different codons but within codon families some are used more frequently than others. This phenomenon is referred to as synonymous codon usage bias. The genomes of free-living unicellular organisms such as bacteria have an extreme codon usage bias and the degree of bias differs between genes within the same genome. The strong positive correlation between codon usage bias and gene expression levels in many microorganisms is attributed to selection for translational efficiency. However, this putative selective advantage has never been measured in bacteria and theoretical estimates vary widely. By systematically exchanging optimal codons for synonymous codons in the tuf genes we quantified the selective advantage of biased codon usage in highly expressed genes to be in the range 0.2–4.2 x 10−4 per codon per generation. These data quantify for the first time the potential for selection on synonymous codon choice to drive genome-wide sequence evolution in bacteria, and in particular to optimize the sequences of highly expressed genes. This quantification may have predictive applications in the design of synthetic genes and for heterologous gene expression in biotechnology.},

Analyzing proteomic data from Escherichia coli, we present direct, global evidence for this prediction. The experimentally measured codon-specific translational accuracies validate a sequence-based proxy; this proxy provides support for the TAH from the vast majority of over 1000 taxa surveyed in all domains of life. We find that the relative translational accuracies of synonymous codons vary substantially among taxa and are strongly correlated with the amounts of cognate transfer RNAs (tRNAs) relative to those of near-cognate tRNAs. These and other observations suggest a model in which selections for translational efficiency and accuracy drive codon usage bias and its coevolution with the tRNA pool.},

The mechanisms specifying the correct recognition of these tiny introns remain poorly understood. Splicing can occur cotranscriptionally, and it has been proposed that chromatin structure might influence splice site recognition. To investigate the roles of nucleosome positioning in intron recognition, we determined the nucleosome occupancy along the P. tetraurelia genome. We show that P. tetraurelia displays a regular nucleosome array with a nucleosome repeat length of ∼151 bp, among the smallest periodicities reported. Our analysis has revealed that introns are frequently associated with inter-nucleosomal DNA, pointing to an evolutionary constraint favoring introns at the AT-rich nucleosome edge sequences. Using accurate splicing efficiency data from cells depleted for nonsense-mediated decay effectors, we show that introns located at the edge of nucleosomes display higher splicing efficiency than those at the center. However, multiple regression analysis indicates that the low GC content of introns, rather than nucleosome positioning, is associated with high splicing efficiency. Our data reveal a complex link between GC content, nucleosome positioning, and intron evolution in Paramecium.},

The ‘success’, or genome-wide abundance, of TEs differs widely between species. Deciphering the causes for this large variety in TE abundance has remained a central question in evolutionary genomics. We previously proposed that species-specific TE abundance could be driven by the inadvertent consequences of host-direct epigenetic silencing of TEs—the spreading of repressive epigenetic marks from silenced TEs into adjacent sequences. Here, we compared this TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive marks, or ‘the epigenetic effect of TEs’, in six species in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup to dissect step-by-step the role of such effect in determining genomic TE abundance. We found that TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive marks is prevalent and substantially varies across and even within species. While this TE-mediated effect alters the epigenetic states of adjacent genes, we surprisingly discovered that the transcription of neighboring genes could reciprocally impact this spreading. Importantly, our multi-species analysis provides the power and appropriate phylogenetic resolution to connect species-specific host chromatin regulation, TE-mediated epigenetic effects, the strength of natural selection against TEs, and genomic TE abundance unique to individual species. Our findings point toward the importance of host chromatin landscapes in shaping genome evolution through the epigenetic effects of a selfish genetic parasite.},

	abstract = {Protein coding genes terminate with one of three stop codons (TAA, TGA, or TAG) that, like synonymous codons, are not employed equally. With TGA and TAG having identical nucleotide content, analysis of their differential usage provides an unusual window into the forces operating on what are ostensibly functionally identical residues. Across genomes and between isochores within the human genome, TGA usage increases with G + C content but, with a common G + C → A + T mutation bias, this cannot be explained by mutation bias-drift equilibrium. Increased usage of TGA in G + C-rich genomes or genomic regions is also unlikely to reflect selection for the optimal stop codon, as TAA appears to be universally optimal, probably because it has the lowest read-through rate. Despite TAA being favored by selection and mutation bias, as with codon usage bias G + C pressure is the prime determinant of between-species TGA usage trends. In species with strong G + C-biased gene conversion (gBGC), such as mammals and birds, the high usage and conservation of TGA is best explained by an A + T → G + C repair bias. How to explain TGA enrichment in other G + C-rich genomes is less clear. Enigmatically, across bacterial and archaeal species and between human isochores TAG usage is mostly unresponsive to G + C pressure. This unresponsiveness we dub the TAG paradox as currently no mutational, selective, or gBGC model provides a well-supported explanation. That TAG does increase with G + C usage across eukaryotes makes the usage elsewhere yet more enigmatic. We suggest resolution of the TAG paradox may provide insights into either an unknown but common selective preference (probably at the DNA/RNA level) or an unrecognized complexity to the action of gBGC.},

	abstract = {The assumption that conservation of sequence implies the action of purifying selection is central to diverse methodologies to infer functional importance. GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), a meiotic mismatch repair bias strongly favouring GC over AT, can in principle mimic the action of selection, this being thought to be especially important in mammals. As mutation is GC→AT biased, to demonstrate that gBGC does indeed cause false signals requires evidence that an AT-rich residue is selectively optimal compared to its more GC-rich allele, while showing also that the GC-rich alternative is conserved. We propose that mammalian stop codon evolution provides a robust test case. Although in most taxa TAA is the optimal stop codon, TGA is both abundant and conserved in mammalian genomes. We show that this mammalian exceptionalism is well explained by gBGC mimicking purifying selection and that TAA is the selectively optimal codon. Supportive of gBGC, we observe (i) TGA usage trends are consistent at the focal stop codon and elsewhere (in UTR sequences); (ii) that higher TGA usage and higher TAA→TGA substitution rates are predicted by a high recombination rate; and (iii) across species the difference in TAA {\textless}-{\textgreater} TGA substitution rates between GC-rich and GC-poor genes is largest in genomes that possess higher between-gene GC variation. TAA optimality is supported both by enrichment in highly expressed genes and trends associated with effective population size. High TGA usage and high TAA→TGA rates in mammals are thus consistent with gBGC’s predicted ability to “drive” deleterious mutations and supports the hypothesis that sequence conservation need not be indicative of purifying selection. A general trend for GC-rich trinucleotides to reside at frequencies far above their mutational equilibrium in high recombining domains supports the generality of these results.},

Standard methods for estimating dN, dS, or ω rely on the assumption that the base composition of sequences is at the equilibrium of the evolutionary process. In many clades, this assumption of stationarity is in fact incorrect, and we show here through simulations and analyses of empirical data that nonstationarity biases the estimate of dN, dS, and ω. We show that the bias in the estimate of ω can be fixed by explicitly taking into consideration nonstationarity in the modeling of codon evolution, in a maximum likelihood framework. Moreover, we propose an exact method for estimating dN and dS on branches, based on stochastic mapping, that can take into account nonstationarity.

Estimates of counts of sites that have a certain number of copies of the derived allele in a sample (the unfolded site frequency spectrum, uSFS) made by parsimony are therefore also biased. We previously developed a maximum likelihood method to estimate the uSFS for a focal species using information from two outgroups while assuming simple models of nucleotide substitution. Here, we extend this approach to allow multiple outgroups (implemented for three outgroups), potentially any phylogenetic tree topology, and more complex models of nucleotide substitution. We ﬁnd, however, that two outgroups and the Kimura two-parameter model are adequate for uSFS inference in most cases. We show that using parsimony to infer the ancestral state at a speciﬁc site seriously breaks down in two situations. The ﬁrst is where the outgroups provide no information about the ancestral state of variation in the focal species. In this case, nucleotide variation will be underestimated if such sites are excluded. The second is where the minor allele in the focal species agrees with the allelic state of the outgroups. In this situation, parsimony tends to overestimate the probability of the major allele being derived, because it fails to account for the fact that sites with a high frequency of the derived allele tend to be rare. We present a method that corrects this deﬁciency and is capable of providing nearly unbiased estimates of ancestral state probabilities on a site-by-site basis and the uSFS.},

However, for a given sequence alignment, it is often difficult to uncover what factors caused this heterogeneity. In fact, identifying and characterizing heterogeneous patterns of molecular evolution along a phylogenetic tree is very challenging, for lack of appropriate methods. Users either have to a priori define groups of branches along which they believe molecular evolution has been similar or have to allow each branch to have its own pattern of molecular evolution. The first approach assumes prior knowledge that is seldom available, and the second requires estimating an unreasonably large number of parameters. Here we propose a convenient and reliable approach where branches get clustered by their pattern of molecular evolution alone, with no need for prior knowledge about the data set under study. Model selection is achieved in a statistical framework and therefore avoids overparameterization. We rely on substitution mapping for efficiency and present two clustering approaches, depending on whether or not we expect neighbouring branches to share more similar patterns of sequence evolution than distant branches. We validate our method on simulations and test it on four previously published data sets. We find that our method correctly groups branches sharing similar equilibrium GC contents in a data set of ribosomal RNAs and recovers expected footprints of selection through dN/dS. Importantly, it also uncovers a new pattern of relaxed selection in a phylogeny of Mantellid frogs, which we are able to correlate to life-history traits. This shows that our programs should be very useful to study patterns of molecular evolution and reveal new correlations between sequence and species evolution. Our programs can run on DNA, RNA, codon, or amino acid sequences with a large set of possible models of substitutions and are available at http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr/forge/testnh.},

	abstract = {RNA sequencing has opened new avenues for the study of transcriptome composition. Significant evidence has accumulated showing that the human transcriptome contains in excess of a hundred thousand different transcripts. However, it is still not clear to what extent this diversity prevails when considering the relative abundances of different transcripts from the same gene. Here we show that, in a given condition, most protein coding genes have one major transcript expressed at significantly higher level than others, that in human tissues the major transcripts contribute almost 85 percent to the total mRNA from protein coding loci, and that often the same major transcript is expressed in many tissues. We detect a high degree of overlap between the set of major transcripts and a recently published set of alternatively spliced transcripts that are predicted to be translated utilizing proteomic data. Thus, we hypothesize that although some minor transcripts may play a functional role, the major ones are likely to be the main contributors to the proteome. However, we still detect a non-negligible fraction of protein coding genes for which the major transcript does not code a protein. Overall, our findings suggest that the transcriptome from protein coding loci is dominated by one transcript per gene and that not all the transcripts that contribute to transcriptome diversity are equally likely to contribute to protein diversity. This observation can help to prioritize candidate targets in proteomics research and to predict the functional impact of the detected changes in variation studies.},

These features and the monopolization of reproduction by only one or few individuals in a colony should affect molecular evolution by reducing the effective population size. We tested this prediction by analysing genome-wide patterns of coding sequence polymorphism and divergence in eusocial vs. noneusocial insects based on newly generated RNA-seq data. We report very low amounts of genetic polymorphism and an elevated ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes – a marker of the effective population size – in four distinct species of eusocial insects, which were more similar to vertebrates than to solitary insects regarding molecular evolutionary processes. Moreover, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions was positively correlated with the level of social complexity across ant species. These results are fully consistent with the hypothesis of a reduced effective population size and an increased genetic load in eusocial insects, indicating that the evolution of social life has important consequences at both the genomic and population levels.},

Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94\% of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86\% with a minor isoform frequency of 15\% or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

	abstract = {Life history theory predicts that the intensity of selection declines with age, and this trend should impact how genes expressed at different ages evolve. Here we find consistent relationships between a gene’s age of expression and patterns of molecular evolution in two mammals (the human Homo sapiens and the mouse Mus musculus) and two insects (the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster). When expressed later in life, genes fix nonsynonymous mutations more frequently, are more polymorphic for nonsynonymous mutations, and have shorter evolutionary lifespans, relative to those expressed early. The latter pattern is explained by a simple evolutionary model. Further, early-expressed genes tend to be enriched in similar gene ontology terms across species, while late-expressed genes show no such consistency. In humans, late-expressed genes are more likely to be linked to cancer and to segregate for dominant disease-causing mutations. Last, the effective strength of selection (Ne s) decreases and the fraction of beneficial mutations increases with a gene’s age of expression. These results are consistent with the diminishing efficacy of purifying selection with age, as proposed by Medawar’s classic hypothesis for the evolution of senescence, and provide links between life history theory and molecular evolution.},

	abstract = {Alternative transcriptional initiation (ATI) refers to the frequent observation that one gene has multiple transcription start sites (TSSs). Although this phenomenon is thought to be adaptive, the specific advantage is rarely known. Here, we propose that each gene has one optimal TSS and that ATI arises primarily from imprecise transcriptional initiation that could be deleterious. This error hypothesis predicts that (i) the TSS diversity of a gene reduces with its expression level; (ii) the fractional use of the major TSS increases, but that of each minor TSS decreases, with the gene expression level; and (iii) cis-elements for major TSSs are selectively constrained, while those for minor TSSs are not. By contrast, the adaptive hypothesis does not make these predictions a priori. Our analysis of human and mouse transcriptomes confirms each of the three predictions. These and other findings strongly suggest that ATI predominantly results from molecular errors, requiring a major revision of our understanding of the precision and regulation of transcription., The transcription of a gene may start from one of several transcription start sites, a phenomenon known as alternative transcriptional initiation. Contrary to common belief, this study shows that variation of the transcription start site of a given gene is nonadaptive and is largely attributable to transcriptional initiation error that is typically deleterious., Multiple surveys of transcriptional initiation showed that mammalian genes typically have multiple transcription start sites such that transcription is initiated from any one of these sites. Many researchers believe that this phenomenon is adaptive because it allows production of multiple transcripts, from the same gene, that potentially vary in function or post-transcriptional regulation. Nevertheless, it is also possible that each gene has only one optimal transcription start site and that alternative transcriptional initiation arises primarily from molecular errors that are slightly deleterious. This error hypothesis makes a series of predictions about the amount of transcription start site diversity per gene, relative uses of the various start sites of a gene, among-tissue and across-species differences in start site usage, and the evolutionary conservation of cis-regulatory elements of various start sites, all of which are verified in our analyses of genome-wide transcription start site data from the human and mouse. These findings strongly suggest that alternative transcriptional initiation largely reflects molecular errors instead of molecular adaptations and require a rethink of the precision and regulation of transcription.},

	abstract = {Gene expression is imperfect, sometimes leading to toxic products. Solutions take two forms: globally reducing error rates, or ensuring that the consequences of erroneous expression are relatively harmless. The latter is optimal, but because it must evolve independently at so many loci, it is subject to a stringent “drift barrier”—a limit to how weak the effects of a deleterious mutation s can be, while still being effectively purged by selection, expressed in terms of the population size N of an idealized population such that purging requires s \&lt; −1/N. In previous work, only large populations evolved the optimal local solution, small populations instead evolved globally low error rates, and intermediate populations were bistable, with either solution possible. Here, we take into consideration the fact that the effectiveness of purging varies among loci, because of variation in gene expression level, and variation in the intrinsic vulnerabilities of different gene products to error. The previously found dichotomy between the two kinds of solution breaks down, replaced by a gradual transition as a function of population size. In the extreme case of a small enough population, selection fails to maintain even the global solution against deleterious mutations, explaining the nonmonotonic relationship between effective population size and transcriptional error rate that was recently observed in experiments on Escherichia coli, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Buchnera aphidicola.},

Newly-identified splice sites show little evidence of evolutionary conservation, suggesting that the majority are due to erroneous splice site choice. We show that sequence motifs involved in the recognition of exons are enriched in the vicinity of unconserved splice sites. We estimate that the average intron has a splicing error rate of approximately 0.7\% and show that introns in highly expressed genes are spliced more accurately, likely due to their shorter length.

However, recent developments in long-read sequencing and the generation of high-quality genome assemblies for diverse organisms has facilitated comparisons of splicing profiles between closely related species, providing insights into how alternative splicing evolves over shorter timescales.

	abstract = {We compared life-history traits and extinction risk of chondrichthyans (sharks, rays and chimaeras), a group of high conservation concern, from the three major marine habitats (continental shelves, open ocean and deep sea), controlling for phylogenetic correlation. Deep-water chondrichthyans had a higher age at maturity and longevity, and a lower growth completion rate than shallow-water species. The average fishing mortality needed to drive a deep-water chondrichthyan species to extinction (Fextinct) was 38–58\% of that estimated for oceanic and continental shelf species, respectively. Mean values of Fextinct were 0.149, 0.250 and 0.368 for deep-water, oceanic and continental shelf species, respectively. Reproductive mode was an important determinant of extinction risk, while body size had a weak effect on extinction risk. As extinction risk was highly correlated with phylogeny, the loss of species will be accompanied by a loss of phylogenetic diversity. Conservation priority should not be restricted to large species, as is usually suggested, since many small species, like those inhabiting the deep ocean, are also highly vulnerable to extinction. Fishing mortality of deep-water chondrichthyans already exploited should be minimized, and new deep-water fisheries affecting chondrichthyans should be prevented.},

The publication of seven ant genomes within the past year was a quantum leap for socio- and ant genomics. The diversity of social organization in ants makes them excellent model organisms to study the evolution of social systems. Comparing the ant genomes with those of the honeybee, a lineage that evolved eusociality independently from ants, and solitary insects suggests that there are significant differences in key aspects of genome organization between social and solitary insects, as well as among ant species. Altogether, these seven ant genomes open exciting new research avenues and opportunities for understanding the genetic basis and regulation of social species, and adaptive complex systems in general.},

	abstract = {Diet is generally believed to affect the aging process. The effects of complex foods on life span can be investigated using simple models that produce rapid results and allow the identification of food–gene interactions. Here, we show that 1 \% lyophilized broccoli, added to flour as a dietary source, significantly increases the life span of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) under physiological conditions (32 °C) and under heat stress (42 °C). The beneficial effects of broccoli could also be reproduced by supplementing flour with the isothiocyanate sulforaphane at concentrations found in the broccoli-supplemented diet. We identified stress-resistant genes responsible for these effects on longevity by microinjecting pupae with double-stranded RNA to induce RNA interference (RNAi). The knockdown of transcripts encoding homologs of Nrf-2, Jnk-1 and Foxo-1 reduced the life span of beetles and abrogated the beneficial effects of broccoli, whereas the knockdown of Sirt-1 and Sirt-3 had no impact in either scenario. In conclusion, T. castaneum is a suitable model organism to investigate food–gene interactions that affect stress resistance and longevity, and RNAi can be used to identify functionally relevant genes. As a proof of principle, we have shown here that broccoli increases the longevity of beetles and mediates its effect through signaling pathways that include key stress-resistant factors such as Nrf-2, Jnk-1 and Foxo-1.},

In the highly eusocial insects, great degrees of variation in lifespan exist between morphological castes in relation to extreme divisions of labour, but of particular interest are the primitively eusocial insects. These species represent the ancestral beginnings of eusociality, in which castes are flexible and based on behaviour rather than morphology. Here we present data on the longevity of the primitively eusocial Neotropical paper wasp P. canadensis, in a captive setting removed of environmental hazards. Captive Polistes canadensis had an average lifespan of 193 ± 10.5 days; although this average is shorter than most bee and ant queens, one individual lived for 506 days in the lab—longer than most recorded wasps and bees. Natal colony variation in longevity does exist between P. canadensis colonies, possibly due to nutritional and genetic factors. This study provides a foundation for future investigations on the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on longevity in primitively eusocial insects, as well as the relationship with natal group and cohort size.},

The impact of competition on larval growth has been thoroughly examined and findings that larval competition can lead to density-dependent effects on adult body size have been documented. The effects of larval competition on adult longevity have been less well explored. The effects of intraspecific larval densities on the longevity of adults maintained under relatively harsh environmental conditions were tested in the laboratory by measuring the longevity of adult Aedes aegypti (L.) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) that had been reared under a range of larval densities and subsequently maintained in high- or low-humidity regimes (85\% or 35\% relative humidity [RH], respectively) as adults. We found significant negative effects of competition on adult longevity in Ae. aegypti, but not in Ae. albopictus. Multivariate analysis of variance suggested that the negative effect of the larval environment on the longevity of Ae. aegypti adults was most strongly associated with increased development time and decreased wing length as adults. Understanding how larval competition affects adult longevity under a range of environmental conditions is important in establishing the relationship between models of mosquito population regulation and epidemiological models of vector-borne disease transmission.},

Both worker population and diapause duration showed significant effect on sexual gyne production, foundress queen longevity and colony longevity but their interaction effect was insignificant.

	abstract = {1. With unfed 1st instars the relation between mean length of life and saturation deficit at constant temperatures between 7 and 15° C. at relative humidities between 7 and 90\% is hyperbolic. The relationship becomes more linear at higher temperatures.At constant saturation deficits insects live longer at 15° C. than at lower temperatures. Longevity also decreases with rise of temperature above approximately 15° C.2. In general, the longevity curves, except for those at temperatures below 15° C., bear a very similar relation to saturation deficit and to each other as the reciprocal curves for rate of water-loss at the different temperatures.The influence of climatic factors on longevity at constant temperatures is discussed at length and it is concluded that over much of the temperature and humidity range survival time is limited by water-loss. At the higher humidities it is thought that either food, or perhaps an excessive accumulation of water within the insect, limits survival and causes a departure from the hyperbolic relation of longevity to saturation deficit.3. The effects on longevity of a single meal are discussed. The principal effect of a blood meal is to increase the time of survival. But the factors which limit survival at different humidities appear to be the same as with unfed bugs, except at high humidities below about 15° C.4.Mellanby's data on the rate of water-loss from fasting adult bed-bugs is analysed. It is found that the rate of water-loss is directly proportional to saturation deficit at constant temperatures between 8 and 37° C. and between 0 and 90\% r.h. Although the rate may always be directly proportional to saturation deficit, the expression  is not always constant.Rate = K + b (saturation deficit), where K varies with temperature and b remains constant.5. Longevity in relation to host blood is discussed. Rabbit blood appears to be slightly less favourable to survival than human blood.6. If bugs are allowed to feed to repletion, longevity is not correlated with the size of the meal, nor with the weight of the unfed insect.Virgin females live longer than mated ones, but no effects of mating on survival were noticed with males. Mated males tend to outlive mated females except at very low temperatures: virgin females live longer than unmated males.7. The results of other workers and the possible causes of some discrepancies are discussed.8. The maximum survival times of bugs are listed. Adults and 5th instars live longer than other stages. In a house which has remained empty for a long time it is probable that 5th instars and adults, particularly unmated female adults, would predominate in the population.The longest observed survival was between 562 and 572 days.},

	abstract = {Endoreduplication or nuclear genome replication without cell division is widely observed in the metabolically active tissues of plants and animals. The fat body cells of adult female insects produce abundant yolk proteins and become polyploid, which is assumed to accelerate egg production. Recently, it was reported that in termites, endopolyploidy in the fat body occurs only in queens but not in the other females; however, the relationship between the fecundity and ploidy level in the fat body remains unclear. Termite queens exhibit a huge variation in their egg-producing capacity among different species; queens in the species with a foraging lifestyle, in which workers leave the nest to forage outside, are much more fecund than those in the species living in a single piece of wood. In this study, we conducted ploidy analyses on three foragings and three wood-dwelling termites via flow cytometry. In all the species, the fat body of queens contained significantly more polyploid cells than that of other nonreproductive females, considering their body size effect. However, the male fat body, which is not involved in yolk production, did not show consistency in polyploid cell numbers among the species studied. Moreover, highly fecund queens in foraging termites exhibit higher levels of endopolyploidy in their fat body than those with less fecundity in wood-dwelling termites. These results suggest that endopolyploidy in the fat body of termite queens can boost their egg production, and the level of endopolyploidy in their fat body is linked to their fecundity. Our study provides a novel insight into the evolutionary relationship between endoreduplication and caste specialization in social insects.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.
RESULTS: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: BEDTools was written in C++. Source code and a comprehensive user manual are freely available at http://code.google.com/p/bedtools

	abstract = {Errors in gene transcription can be costly, and organisms have evolved to prevent their occurrence or mitigate their costs. The simplest interpretation of the drift barrier hypothesis suggests that species with larger population sizes would have lower transcriptional error rates. However, Escherichia coli seems to have a higher transcriptional error rate than species with lower effective population sizes, for example Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This could be explained if selection in E. coli were strong enough to maintain adaptations that mitigate the consequences of transcriptional errors through robustness, on a gene by gene basis, obviating the need for low transcriptional error rates and associated costs of global proofreading. Here, we note that if selection is powerful enough to evolve local robustness, selection should also be powerful enough to locally reduce error rates. We therefore predict that transcriptional error rates will be lower in highly abundant proteins on which selection is strongest. However, we only expect this result when error rates are high enough to signiﬁcantly impact ﬁtness. As expected, we ﬁnd such a relationship between expression and transcriptional error rate for non-C!U errors in E. coli (especially G!A), but not in S. cerevisiae. We do not ﬁnd this pattern for C!U changes in E. coli, presumably because most deamination events occurred during sample preparation, but do for C!U changes in S. cerevisiae, supporting the interpretation that C!U error rates estimated with an improved protocol, and which occur at rates comparable with E. coli non-C!U errors, are biological.},

We assessed AS patterns across pre- and postnatal development of seven organs in six mammals and a bird. Our analyses revealed that developmentally dynamic AS events, which are especially prevalent in the brain, are substantially more conserved than nondynamic ones. Cassette exons with increasing inclusion frequencies during development show the strongest signals of conserved and regulated AS. Newly emerged cassette exons are typically incorporated late in testis development, but those retained during evolution are predominantly brain specific. Our work suggests that an intricate interplay of programs controlling gene expression levels and AS is fundamental to organ development, especially for the brain and heart. In these regulatory networks, AS affords substantial functional diversification of genes through the generation of tissue- and time-specific isoforms from broadly expressed genes.},

Differentially spliced genes were primarily enriched for muscle development and functioning, while differentially expressed genes were involved in metabolism, immunity and growth. Furthermore, alternative splicing and gene expression were mostly controlled by independent cis-regulatory quantitative trait loci ({\textless}3.4\% overlap). Cis-regulatory regions were associated with the parallel divergence in splicing (16.5\% of intron clusters) and expression (6.7\%–10.1\% of differentially expressed genes), indicating shared regulatory variation across ecotype pairs. Contrary to theoretical expectation, we found that differentially spliced genes tended to be highly central in regulatory networks (“hub genes”) and were annotated to significantly more gene ontology terms compared to nondifferentially spliced genes, consistent with a higher level of pleiotropy. Together, our results suggest that the concerted regulation of alternative splicing and differential gene expression through different regulatory regions leads to the divergence of complementary processes important for local adaptation. This provides novel insights into the importance of contrasting but putatively complementary molecular processes in rapid parallel adaptive evolution.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) has the potential to greatly expand the functional repertoire of mammalian transcriptomes. However, few variant transcripts have been characterized functionally, making it difficult to assess the contribution of AS to the generation of phenotypic complexity and to study the evolution of splicing patterns. We have compared the AS of 309 protein-coding genes in the human ENCODE pilot regions against their mouse orthologs in unprecedented detail, utilizing traditional transcriptomic and RNAseq data. The conservation status of every transcript has been investigated, and each functionally categorized as coding (separated into coding sequence [CDS] or nonsense-mediated decay [NMD] linked) or noncoding. In total, 36.7\% of human and 19.3\% of mouse coding transcripts are species specific, and we observe a 3.6 times excess of human NMD transcripts compared with mouse; in contrast to previous studies, the majority of species-specific AS is unlinked to transposable elements. We observe one conserved CDS variant and one conserved NMD variant per 2.3 and 11.4 genes, respectively. Subsequently, we identify and characterize equivalent AS patterns for 22.9\% of these CDS or NMD-linked events in nonmammalian vertebrate genomes, and our data indicate that functional NMD-linked AS is more widespread and ancient than previously thought. Furthermore, although we observe an association between conserved AS and elevated sequence conservation, as previously reported, we emphasize that 30\% of conserved AS exons display sequence conservation below the average score for constitutive exons. In conclusion, we demonstrate the value of detailed comparative annotation in generating a comprehensive set of AS transcripts, increasing our understanding of AS evolution in vertebrates. Our data supports a model whereby the acquisition of functional AS has occurred throughout vertebrate evolution and is considered alongside amino acid change as a key mechanism in gene evolution.},

Many cryptic sequences have strongly deleterious effects, for example when they cause protein misfolding. Strongly deleterious effects can be avoided globally by avoiding making errors (e.g., via proofreading machinery) or locally by ensuring that each error has a relatively benign effect. The local solution requires powerful selection acting on every cryptic site and so evolves only in large populations. Small populations with less effective selection evolve global solutions. Here we show that for a large range of realistic intermediate population sizes, the evolutionary dynamics are bistable and either solution may result. The local solution facilitates the genetic assimilation of cryptic genetic variation and therefore substantially increases evolvability.},

	abstract = {C-to-U RNA editing enzymatically converts the base C to U in RNA molecules and could lead to nonsynonymous changes when occurring in coding regions. Hundreds to thousands of coding sites were recently found to be C-to-U edited or editable in humans, but the biological significance of this phenomenon is elusive. Here, we test the prevailing hypothesis that nonsynonymous editing is beneficial because it provides a means for tissue- or time-specific regulation of protein function that may be hard to accomplish by mutations due to pleiotropy. The adaptive hypothesis predicts that the fraction of sites edited and the median proportion of RNA molecules edited (i.e., editing level) are both higher for nonsynonymous than synonymous editing. However, our empirical observations are opposite to these predictions. Furthermore, the frequency of nonsynonymous editing, relative to that of synonymous editing, declines as genes become functionally more important or evolutionarily more constrained, and the nonsynonymous editing level at a site is negatively correlated with the evolutionary conservation of the site. Together, these findings refute the adaptive hypothesis; they instead indicate that the reported C-to-U coding RNA editing is mostly slightly deleterious or neutral, probably resulting from off-target activities of editing enzymes. Along with similar conclusions on the more prevalent A-to-I editing and m6A modification of coding RNAs, our study suggests that, at least in humans, most events of each type of posttranscriptional coding RNA modification likely manifest cellular errors rather than adaptations, demanding a paradigm shift in the research of posttranscriptional modification.},

	abstract = {Methylation of the adenosine base at the nitrogen-6 position (m6A) is the most prevalent internal posttranscriptional modification of mRNAs in many eukaryotes. Despite the rapid progress in the transcriptome-wide mapping of m6As, identification of proteins responsible for writing, reading, and erasing m6As, and elucidation of m6A functions in splicing, RNA stability, translation, and other processes, it is unknown whether most observed m6A modifications are functional. To address this question, we respectively analyze the evolutionary conservation of yeast and human m6As in protein-coding regions. Relative to comparable unmethylated As, m6As are overall no more conserved in yeasts and only slightly more conserved in mammals. Furthermore, yeast m6As and comparable unmethylated As have no significant difference in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density or SNP site frequency spectrum. The same is true in human. The methylation status of a gene, not necessarily the specific sites methylated in the gene, is subject to purifying selection for no more than ∼20\% of m6A-modified genes. These observations suggest that most m6A modifications in protein-coding regions are nonfunctional and nonadaptive, probably resulting from off-target activities of m6A methyltransferases. In addition, our reanalysis invalidates the recent claim of positive selection for newly acquired m6A modifications in human evolution. Regarding the small number of evolutionarily conserved m6As, evidence suggests that a large proportion of them are likely functional; they should be prioritized in future functional characterizations of m6As. Together, these findings have important implications for understanding the biological significance of m6A and other posttranscriptional modifications.},

Diverse transcript isoforms arise from the use of alternative transcription start sites, polyadenylation sites and splice sites; however, the relative contribution of these processes to isoform diversity in normal human physiology is unclear. To address this question, we investigated cell type-dependent differences in exon usage of over 18 000 protein-coding genes in 23 cell types from 798 samples of the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project. We found that about half of the expressed genes displayed tissue-dependent transcript isoforms. Alternative transcription start and termination sites, rather than alternative splicing, accounted for the majority of tissue-dependent exon usage. We confirmed the widespread tissue-dependent use of alternative transcription start sites in a second, independent dataset, Cap Analysis of Gene Expression data from the FANTOM consortium. Moreover, our results indicate that most tissue-dependent splicing involves untranslated exons and therefore may not increase proteome complexity. Thus, alternative transcription start and termination sites are the principal drivers of transcript isoform diversity across tissues, and may underlie the majority of cell type specific proteomes and functions.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing of messenger RNA can generate a wide variety of mature RNA transcripts, and these transcripts may produce protein isoforms with diverse cellular functions. While there is much supporting evidence for the expression of alternative transcripts, the same is not true for the alternatively spliced protein products. Large-scale mass spectroscopy experiments have identified evidence of alternative splicing at the protein level, but with conflicting results. Here we carried out a rigorous analysis of the peptide evidence from eight large-scale proteomics experiments to assess the scale of alternative splicing that is detectable by high-resolution mass spectroscopy. We find fewer splice events than would be expected: we identified peptides for almost 64\% of human protein coding genes, but detected just 282 splice events. This data suggests that most genes have a single dominant isoform at the protein level. Many of the alternative isoforms that we could identify were only subtly different from the main splice isoform. Very few of the splice events identified at the protein level disrupted functional domains, in stark contrast to the two thirds of splice events annotated in the human genome that would lead to the loss or damage of functional domains. The most striking result was that more than 20\% of the splice isoforms we identified were generated by substituting one homologous exon for another. This is significantly more than would be expected from the frequency of these events in the genome. These homologous exon substitution events were remarkably conserved—all the homologous exons we identified evolved over 460 million years ago—and eight of the fourteen tissue-specific splice isoforms we identified were generated from homologous exons. The combination of proteomics evidence, ancient origin and tissue-specific splicing indicates that isoforms generated from homologous exons may have important cellular roles.},

Recent analyses indicate that many splicing regulatory proteins are themselves regulated by AS-NMD.

	abstract = {Alternative splicing, a mechanism of post-transcriptional RNA processing whereby a single gene can encode multiple distinct transcripts, has been proposed to underlie morphological innovations in multicellular organisms. Genes with developmental functions are enriched for alternative splicing events, suggestive of a contribution of alternative splicing to developmental programmes. The role of alternative splicing as a source of transcript diversification has previously been compared to that of gene duplication, with the relationship between the two extensively explored. Alternative splicing is reduced following gene duplication with the retention of duplicate copies higher for genes which were alternatively spliced prior to duplication. Furthermore, and unlike the case for overall gene number, the proportion of alternatively spliced genes has also increased in line with the evolutionary diversification of cell types, suggesting alternative splicing may contribute to the complexity of developmental programmes. Together these observations suggest a prominent role for alternative splicing as a source of functional innovation. However, it is unknown whether the proliferation of alternative splicing events indeed reflects a functional expansion of the transcriptome or instead results from weaker selection acting on larger species, which tend to have a higher number of cell types and lower population sizes.

Such simulation procedures are needed to estimate the null-distribution of complex statistics, an approach referred to as parametric bootstrapping, and are also used to test the quality of phylogenetic reconstruction programs. It has often been observed that homologous sequences can vary widely in their nucleotide or amino-acid compositions, revealing that sequence evolution has changed importantly among lineages, and may therefore be most appropriately approached through non-homogeneous models. Several programs implementing such models have been developed, but they are limited in their possibilities: only a few particular models are available for likelihood optimization, and data sets cannot be easily generated using the resulting estimated parameters.},

Traditional multiple sequence alignment methods disregard the phylogenetic implications of gap patterns that they create and infer systematically biased alignments with excess deletions and substitutions, too few insertions, and implausible insertion-deletion–event histories. We present a method that prevents these systematic errors by recognizing insertions and deletions as distinct evolutionary events. We show theoretically and practically that this improves the quality of sequence alignments and downstream analyses over a wide range of realistic alignment problems. These results suggest that insertions and sequence turnover are more common than is currently thought and challenge the conventional picture of sequence evolution and mechanisms of functional and structural changes.},

This relationship determines our ability to predict phenotypes from genotypes and to understand how evolutionary forces shape variation within and between species. Previous efforts to dissect the genotype–phenotype map were based on incomplete genotypic information. Here, we describe the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), a community resource for analysis of population genomics and quantitative traits. The DGRP consists of fully sequenced inbred lines derived from a natural population. Population genomic analyses reveal reduced polymorphism in centromeric autosomal regions and the X chromosome, evidence for positive and negative selection, and rapid evolution of the X chromosome. Many variants in novel genes, most at low frequency, are associated with quantitative traits and explain a large fraction of the phenotypic variance. The DGRP facilitates genotype–phenotype mapping using the power of Drosophila genetics.},

	abstract = {The Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) is a community resource of 205 sequenced inbred lines, derived to improve our understanding of the effects of naturally occurring genetic variation on molecular and organismal phenotypes. We used an integrated genotyping strategy to identify 4,853,802 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1,296,080 non-SNP variants. Our molecular population genomic analyses show higher deletion than insertion mutation rates and stronger purifying selection on deletions. Weaker selection on insertions than deletions is consistent with our observed distribution of genome size determined by flow cytometry, which is skewed toward larger genomes. Insertion/deletion and single nucleotide polymorphisms are positively correlated with each other and with local recombination, suggesting that their nonrandom distributions are due to hitchhiking and background selection. Our cytogenetic analysis identified 16 polymorphic inversions in the DGRP. Common inverted and standard karyotypes are genetically divergent and account for most of the variation in relatedness among the DGRP lines. Intriguingly, variation in genome size and many quantitative traits are significantly associated with inversions. Approximately 50\% of the DGRP lines are infected with Wolbachia, and four lines have germline insertions of Wolbachia sequences, but effects of Wolbachia infection on quantitative traits are rarely significant. The DGRP complements ongoing efforts to functionally annotate the Drosophila genome. Indeed, 15\% of all D. melanogaster genes segregate for potentially damaged proteins in the DGRP, and genome-wide analyses of quantitative traits identify novel candidate genes. The DGRP lines, sequence data, genotypes, quality scores, phenotypes, and analysis and visualization tools are publicly available.},

There are seven sirtuin genes in humans, each consists of multiple exons that are likely to undergo alternative splicing. Our aim was to characterize the effect of alternative splicing on the sirtuin genes. Here, we report the identification of 23 human sirtuin isoforms, most of which were not previously reported. Five of the sirtuin genes had more than one isoform, whereas sirtuin-6 had nine isoforms. Exon skipping was the main event. Most of the sirtuin isoforms were deficient in parts of the protein domains, including the catalytic domain, the N- or C-terminus, nuclear localization signal or mitochondrial targeting signal. The domain loss caused potential structural changes. Three SIRT1 isoforms had a differential effect on the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate. Age-related changes in the expression of SIRT1 isoforms were observed in the human heart in fetus, adults, and very old individuals. We also identified 15 sirtuin isoforms in mice. Our data indicate that alternative splicing increases sirtuin gene diversity and may modulate subcellular localization and function, thereby adding complexity to the gene regulation of mitochondrial respiration, metabolism, and cardiac function during maturation and aging.},

	abstract = {The question is often raised whether it is statistically necessary to control for phylogenetic associations in comparative studies. To investigate this question, we explore the use of a measure of phylogenetic correlation, lambda, introduced by Pagel (1999), that normally varies between 0 (phylogenetic independence) and 1 (species' traits covary in direct proportion to their shared evolutionary history). Simulations show lambda to be a statistically powerful index for measuring whether data exhibit phylogenetic dependence or not and whether it has low rates of Type I error. Moreover, lambda is robust to incomplete phylogenetic information, which demonstrates that even partial information on phylogeny will improve the accuracy of phylogenetic analyses. To assess whether traits generally show phylogenetic associations, we present a quantitative review of 26 published phylogenetic comparative data sets. The data sets include 103 traits and were chosen from the ecological literature in which debate about the need for phylogenetic correction has been most acute. Eighty-eight percent of data sets contained at least one character that displayed significant phylogenetic dependence, and 60\% of characters overall (pooled across studies) showed significant evidence of phylogenetic association. In 16\% of tests, phylogenetic correlation could be neither supported nor rejected. However, most of these equivocal results were found in small phylogenies and probably reflect a lack of power. We suggest that the parameter lambda be routinely estimated when analyzing comparative data, since it can also be used simultaneously to adjust the phylogenetic correction in a manner that is optimal for the data set, and we present an example of how this may be done.

The number and variety of modifications suggest different mechanisms of action during messenger RNA decoding, of which only a few were described so far. Here, on the basis of several 70S ribosome complex X-ray structures, we demonstrate how Escherichia coli tRNALysUUU with hypermodified 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm5s2U) at the wobble position discriminates between cognate codons AAA and AAG, and near-cognate stop codon UAA or isoleucine codon AUA, with which it forms pyrimidine–pyrimidine mismatches. We show that mnm5s2U forms an unusual pair with guanosine at the wobble position that expands general knowledge on the degeneracy of the genetic code and specifies a powerful role of tRNA modifications in translation. Our models consolidate the translational fidelity mechanism proposed previously where the steric complementarity and shape acceptance dominate the decoding mechanism.},

Recent work has focused on the improvement of the EPD promoter viewers, which use the UCSC Genome Browser as visualization platform. Thousands of high-resolution tracks for CAGE, ChIP-seq and similar data have been generated and organized into public track hubs. Customized, reproducible promoter views, combining EPD-supplied tracks with native UCSC Genome Browser tracks, can be accessed from the organism summary pages or from individual promoter entries. Moreover, thanks to recent improvements and stabilization of ncRNA gene catalogs, we were able to release promoter collections for certain classes of ncRNAs from human and mouse. Furthermore, we developed automatic computational protocols to assign orphan TSS peaks to downstream genes based on paired-end (RAMPAGE) TSS mapping data, which enabled us to add nearly 9000 new entries to the human promoter collection.

	abstract = {Hymenoptera (sawflies, wasps, ants, and bees) are one of four mega-diverse insect orders, comprising more than 153,000 described and possibly up to one million undescribed extant species [1, 2]. As parasitoids, predators, and pollinators, Hymenoptera play a fundamental role in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems and are of substantial economic importance [1, 3]. To understand the diversification and key evolutionary transitions of Hymenoptera, most notably from phytophagy to parasitoidism and predation (and vice versa) and from solitary to eusocial life, we inferred the phylogeny and divergence times of all major lineages of Hymenoptera by analyzing 3,256 protein-coding genes in 173 insect species. Our analyses suggest that extant Hymenoptera started to diversify around 281 million years ago (mya). The primarily ectophytophagous sawflies are found to be monophyletic. The species-rich lineages of parasitoid wasps constitute a monophyletic group as well. The little-known, species-poor Trigonaloidea are identified as the sister group of the stinging wasps (Aculeata). Finally, we located the evolutionary root of bees within the apoid wasp family "Crabronidae." Our results reveal that the extant sawfly diversity is largely the result of a previously unrecognized major radiation of phytophagous Hymenoptera that did not lead to wood-dwelling and parasitoidism. They also confirm that all primarily parasitoid wasps are descendants of a single endophytic parasitoid ancestor that lived around 247 mya. Our findings provide the basis for a natural classification of Hymenoptera and allow for future comparative analyses of Hymenoptera, including their genomes, morphology, venoms, and parasitoid and eusocial life styles.},

	abstract = {Based on the rates of amino acid substitution for 60 mammalian genes of 50 codons or more, it is shown that the rate of amino acid substitution of a protein is correlated with its amino acid composition. In particular, the content of glycine residues is negatively correlated with the rate of amino acid substitution, and this content alone explains about 38\% of the total variation in amino acid substitution rates among different protein families. The propensity of a polypeptide to evolve fast or slowly may be predicted from an index or indices of protein mutability directly derivable from the amino acid composition. The propensity of an amino acid to remain conserved during evolutionary times depends not so much on its being featured prominently in active sites, but on its stability index, defined as the mean chemical distance [R. Grantham (1974) Science 185:862-864] between the amino acid and its mutational derivatives produced by single-nucleotide substitutions. Functional constraints related to active and binding sites of proteins play only a minor role in determining the overall rate of amino acid substitution. The importance of amino acid composition in determining rates of substitution is illustrated with examples involving cytochrome c, cytochrome b5, ras-related genes, the calmodulin protein family, and fibrinopeptides.},

Dramatic adaptive changes in genes underlying the production and perception of pheromones confirm the importance of chemical communication in the termites. These are accompanied by major changes in gene regulation and the molecular evolution of caste determination. Many of these results parallel molecular mechanisms of eusocial evolution in Hymenoptera.

We analyze high-throughput mutagenesis data obtained for an alternatively spliced exon in the proto-oncogene RON and determine the functional units that control this splicing event. Using mathematical modeling of distinct splicing mechanisms, we show that alternative splicing is based in RON on a so-called "exon definition" mechanism. Here, the recognition of the adjacent exons by the spliceosome is required for removal of an intron. We use our model to analyze the differences between the exon and intron definition scenarios and find that exon definition prevents the accumulation of deleterious, partially spliced retention products during alternative splicing regulation. Furthermore, it modularizes splicing control, as multiple regulatory inputs are integrated into a common net input, irrespective of the location and nature of the corresponding cis-regulatory elements in the pre-messenger RNA. Our analysis suggests that exon definition promotes robust and reliable splicing outcomes in RON splicing.},

	abstract = {Background
RNA-seq data is currently underutilized, in part because it is difficult to predict the functional impact of alternate transcription events. Recent software improvements in full-length transcript deconvolution prompted us to develop spliceR, an R package for classification of alternative splicing and prediction of coding potential.

Results
spliceR uses the full-length transcript output from RNA-seq assemblers to detect single or multiple exon skipping, alternative donor and acceptor sites, intron retention, alternative first or last exon usage, and mutually exclusive exon events. For each of these events spliceR also annotates the genomic coordinates of the differentially spliced elements, facilitating downstream sequence analysis. For each transcript isoform fraction values are calculated to identify transcript switching between conditions. Lastly, spliceR predicts the coding potential, as well as the potential nonsense mediated decay (NMD) sensitivity of each transcript.

Conclusions
spliceR is an easy-to-use tool that extends the usability of RNA-seq and assembly technologies by allowing greater depth of annotation of RNA-seq data. spliceR is implemented as an R package and is freely available from the Bioconductor repository (

	abstract = {Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are a genetically diverse species, consisting of four highly distinct subspecies. As humans’ closest living relative, they have been a key model organism in the study of human evolution, and comparisons of human and chimpanzee transcriptomes have been widely used to characterize differences in gene expression levels that could underlie the phenotypic differences between the two species. However, the subspecies from which these transcriptomic data sets have been derived is not recorded in metadata available in the public NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Furthermore, labeling of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) samples is for the most part inconsistent across studies, and the true number of individuals from whom transcriptomic data are available is difficult to ascertain. Thus, we have evaluated genetic diversity at the subspecies and individual level in 486 public RNA-seq samples available in the SRA, spanning the vast majority of public chimpanzee transcriptomic data. Using multiple population genetics approaches, we find that nearly all samples (96.6\%) have some degree of Western chimpanzee ancestry. At the individual donor level, we identify multiple samples that have been repeatedly analyzed across different studies and identify a total of 135 genetically distinct individuals within our data, a number that falls to 89 when we exclude likely first- and second-degree relatives. Altogether, our results show that current transcriptomic data from chimpanzees are capturing low levels of genetic diversity relative to what exists in wild chimpanzee populations. These findings provide important context to current comparative transcriptomics research involving chimpanzees.},

	abstract = {Variation in synonymous codon usage is abundant across multiple levels of organization: between codons of an amino acid, between genes in a genome, and between genomes of different species. It is now well understood that variation in synonymous codon usage is influenced by mutational bias coupled with both natural selection for translational efficiency and genetic drift, but how these processes shape patterns of codon usage bias across entire lineages remains unexplored. To address this question, we used a rich genomic data set of 327 species that covers nearly one third of the known biodiversity of the budding yeast subphylum Saccharomycotina. We found that, while genome-wide relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) for all codons was highly correlated with the GC content of the third codon position (GC3), the usage of codons for the amino acids proline, arginine, and glycine was inconsistent with the neutral expectation where mutational bias coupled with genetic drift drive codon usage. Examination between genes’ effective numbers of codons and their GC3 contents in individual genomes revealed that nearly a quarter of genes (381,174/1,683,203; 23\%), as well as most genomes (308/327; 94\%), significantly deviate from the neutral expectation. Finally, by evaluating the imprint of translational selection on codon usage, measured as the degree to which genes’ adaptiveness to the tRNA pool were correlated with selective pressure, we show that translational selection is widespread in budding yeast genomes (264/327; 81\%). These results suggest that the contribution of translational selection and drift to patterns of synonymous codon usage across budding yeasts varies across codons, genes, and genomes; whereas drift is the primary driver of global codon usage across the subphylum, the codon bias of large numbers of genes in the majority of genomes is influenced by translational selection.},

Eusociality, where workers sacrifice their reproductive rights to support the colony, has evolved repeatedly and represents the most evolved form of social evolution in insects. Kapheim et al. looked across the genomes of 10 bee species with varying degrees of sociality to determine the underlying genomic contributions. No one genomic path led to eusociality, but similarities across genomes were seen in features such as increases in gene regulation and methylation. It also seems that selection pressures relaxed after the emergence of complex sociality.
Science, this issue p. 1139
The evolution of eusociality is one of the major transitions in evolution, but the underlying genomic changes are unknown. We compared the genomes of 10 bee species that vary in social complexity, representing multiple independent transitions in social evolution, and report three major findings. First, many important genes show evidence of neutral evolution as a consequence of relaxed selection with increasing social complexity. Second, there is no single road map to eusociality; independent evolutionary transitions in sociality have independent genetic underpinnings. Third, though clearly independent in detail, these transitions do have similar general features, including an increase in constrained protein evolution accompanied by increases in the potential for gene regulation and decreases in diversity and abundance of transposable elements. Eusociality may arise through different mechanisms each time, but would likely always involve an increase in the complexity of gene networks.
Social evolution in bees has followed diverse genomic paths but shares genomic patterns.

We found that mating with a single male, which maximizes relatedness, is ancestral for all eight independent eusocial lineages that we investigated. Mating with multiple males is always derived. Furthermore, we found that high polyandry ({\textgreater}2 effective mates) occurs only in lineages whose workers have lost reproductive totipotency. These results provide the first evidence that monogamy was critical in the evolution of eusociality, strongly supporting the prediction of inclusive fitness theory.},

	abstract = {Genes and genomes do not evolve similarly in all branches of the tree of life. Detecting and characterizing the heterogeneity in time, and between lineages, of the nucleotide (or amino acid) substitution process is an important goal of current molecular evolutionary research. This task is typically achieved through the use of non-homogeneous models of sequence evolution, which being highly parametrized and computationally-demanding are not appropriate for large-scale analyses. Here we investigate an alternative methodological option based on probabilistic substitution mapping. The idea is to first reconstruct the substitutional history of each site of an alignment under a homogeneous model of sequence evolution, then to characterize variations in the substitution process across lineages based on substitution counts. Using simulated and published datasets, we demonstrate that probabilistic substitution mapping is robust in that it typically provides accurate reconstruction of sequence ancestry even when the true process is heterogeneous, but a homogeneous model is adopted. Consequently, we show that the new approach is essentially as efficient as and extremely faster than (up to 25 000 times) existing methods, thus paving the way for a systematic survey of substitution process heterogeneity across genes and lineages.},

The overall function of alternative splicing is to increase the diversity of mRNAs expressed from the genome. Alternative splicing changes proteins encoded by mRNAs, which has profound functional effects. Experimental analysis of these protein isoforms showed that alternative splicing regulates binding between proteins, between proteins and nucleic acids as well as between proteins and membranes. Alternative splicing regulates the localization of proteins, their enzymatic properties and their interaction with ligands. In most cases, changes caused by individual splicing isoforms are small. However, cells typically coordinate numerous changes in ‘splicing programs’, which can have strong effects on cell proliferation, cell survival and properties of the nervous system. Due to its widespread usage and molecular versatility, alternative splicing emerges as a central element in gene regulation that interferes with almost every biological function analyzed.},

We examined human peripheral blood leukocyte in-vivo RNA in a large-scale transcriptomic microarray study (subjects aged 30–104 years). We tested associations between probe expression intensity and advancing age (adjusting for confounding factors), initially in a discovery set (n = 458), following-up findings in a replication set (n = 240). We confirmed expression of key results by real-time PCR. Of 16 571 expressed probes, only 295 (2\%) were robustly associated with age. Just six probes were required for a highly efficient model for distinguishing between young and old (area under the curve in replication set; 95\%). The focused nature of age-related gene expression may therefore provide potential biomarkers of aging. Similarly, only 7 of 1065 biological or metabolic pathways were age-associated, in gene set enrichment analysis, notably including the processing of messenger RNAs (mRNAs); [P {\textless} 0.002, false discovery rate (FDR) q {\textless} 0.05].

A richer set of analytic data is also presented, including better tRNA functional prediction, non-canonical features, predicted structural impacts from sequence variants and minimum free energy structural predictions.

This unexpectedly narrow range of diversity is known as Lewontin’s Paradox of Variation (1974). While some have suggested selection constrains diversity, tests of this hypothesis seem to fall short. Here, I revisit Lewontin’s Paradox to assess whether current models of linked selection are capable of reducing diversity to this extent. To quantify the discrepancy between pairwise diversity and census population sizes across species, I combine previously-published estimates of pairwise diversity from 172 metazoan taxa with newly derived estimates of census sizes. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, I show this relationship is significant accounting for phylogeny, but with high phylogenetic signal and evidence that some lineages experience shifts in the evolutionary rate of diversity deep in the past. Additionally, I find a negative relationship between recombination map length and census size, suggesting abundant species have less recombination and experience greater reductions in diversity due to linked selection. However, I show that even assuming strong and abundant selection, models of linked selection are unlikely to explain the observed relationship between diversity and census sizes across species.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing of precursor mRNA is an essential mechanism to increase the complexity of gene expression, and it plays an important role in cellular differentiation and organism development. Regulation of alternative splicing is a complicated process in which numerous interacting components are at work, including cis‑acting elements and trans‑acting factors, and is further guided by the functional coupling between transcription and splicing. Additional molecular features, such as chromatin structure, RNA structure and alternative transcription initiation or alternative transcription termination, collaborate with these basic components to generate the protein diversity due to alternative splicing. All these factors contributing to this one fundamental biological process add up to a mechanism that is critical to the proper functioning of cells. Any corruption of the process may lead to disruption of normal cellular function and the eventuality of disease. Cancer is one of those diseases, where alternative splicing may be the basis for the identification of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as new strategies for therapy. Thus, an in‑depth understanding of alternative splicing regulation has the potential not only to elucidate fundamental biological principles, but to provide solutions for various diseases.},

	abstract = {tRNAscan-SE has been widely used for transfer RNA (tRNA) gene prediction for over twenty years, developed just as the first genomes were decoded. With the massive increase in quantity and phylogenetic diversity of genomes, the accurate detection and functional prediction of tRNAs has become more challenging. Utilizing a vastly larger training set, we created nearly one hundred specialized isotype- and clade-specific models, greatly improving tRNAscan-SE’s ability to identify and classify both typical and atypical tRNAs. We employ a new comparative multi-model strategy where predicted tRNAs are scored against a full set of isotype-specific covariance models, allowing functional prediction based on both the anticodon and the highest-scoring isotype model. Comparative model scoring has also enhanced the program's ability to detect tRNA-derived SINEs and other likely pseudogenes. For the first time, tRNAscan-SE also includes fast and highly accurate detection of mitochondrial tRNAs using newly developed models. Overall, tRNA detection sensitivity and specificity is improved for all isotypes, particularly those utilizing specialized models for selenocysteine and the three subtypes of tRNA genes encoding a CAU anticodon. These enhancements will provide researchers with more accurate and detailed tRNA annotation for a wider variety of tRNAs, and may direct attention to tRNAs with novel traits.},

Previous studies, which involved limited numbers of genes, can now be compared against analyses of the entire gene complements of 12 Drosophila species whose genome sequences have become available. Using large numbers (6138) of orthologs represented in all 12 species, we establish that the codon preferences of more closely related species are better correlated. Differences between codon usage biases are attributed, in part, to changes in mutational biases. These biases are apparent from the strong correlation (r = 0.92, P {\textless} 0.001) among these genomes' intronic G + C contents and exonic G + C contents at degenerate third codon positions. To perform a cross-species comparison of selection on codon usage, while accounting for changes in mutational biases, we calibrated each genome in turn using the codon usage bias indices of highly expressed ribosomal protein genes. The strength of translational selection was predicted to have varied between species largely according to their phylogeny, with the D. melanogaster group species exhibiting the strongest degree of selection.},

	abstract = {mRNA translation decodes nucleotide into amino acid sequences. However, translation has also been shown to affect mRNA stability depending on codon composition in model organisms, although universality of this mechanism remains unclear. Here, using three independent approaches to measure exogenous and endogenous mRNA decay, we define which codons are associated with stable or unstable mRNAs in human cells. We demonstrate that the regulatory information affecting mRNA stability is encoded in codons and not in nucleotides. Stabilizing codons tend to be associated with higher tRNA levels and higher charged/total tRNA ratios. While mRNAs enriched in destabilizing codons tend to possess shorter poly(A)-tails, the poly(A)-tail is not required for the codon-mediated mRNA stability. This mechanism depends on translation; however, the number of ribosome loads into a mRNA modulates the codon-mediated effects on gene expression. This work provides definitive evidence that translation strongly affects mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner in human cells.},

We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

The model uses the codon, as opposed to the nucleotide, as the unit of evolution, and is parameterized in terms of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution rates. One of the model's advantages over those used in methods for estimating synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates is that it completely corrects for multiple hits at a codon, rather than taking a parsimony approach and considering only pathways of minimum change between homologous codons. Likelihood-ratio versions of the relative-rate test are constructed and applied to data from the complete chloroplast DNA sequences of Oryza sativa, Nicotiana tabacum, and Marchantia polymorpha. Results of these tests confirm previous findings that substitution rates in the chloroplast genome are subject to both lineage-specific and locus-specific effects. Additionally, the new tests suggest tha the rate heterogeneity is due primarily to differences in nonsynonymous substitution rates. Simulations help confirm previous suggestions that silent sites are saturated, leaving no evidence of heterogeneity in synonymous substitution rates.},

	abstract = {According to the nearly-neutral model, variation in long-term effective population size among species should result in correlated variation in the ratio of nonsynonymous over synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS). Previous empirical investigations in mammals have been consistent with this prediction, suggesting an important role for nearly-neutral effects on protein-coding sequence evolution. GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), on the other hand, is increasingly recognized as a major evolutionary force shaping genome nucleotide composition. When sufficiently strong compared with random drift, gBGC may significantly interfere with a nearly-neutral regime and impact dN/dS in a complex manner. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic correlations between dN/dS, the equilibrium GC composition (GC*), and several life-history and karyotypic traits in placental mammals. We show that the equilibrium GC composition decreases with body mass and increases with the number of chromosomes, suggesting a modulation of the strength of biased gene conversion due to changes in effective population size and genome-wide recombination rate. The variation in dN/dS is complex and only partially fits the prediction of the nearly-neutral theory. However, specifically restricting estimation of the dN/dS ratio on GC-conservative transversions, which are immune from gBGC, results in correlations that are more compatible with a nearly-neutral interpretation. Our investigation indicates the presence of complex interactions between selection and biased gene conversion and suggests that further mechanistic development is warranted, to tease out mutation, selection, drift, and conversion.},

	abstract = {In addition to their common usages to study gene expression, RNA-seq data accumulated over the last 10 years are a yet-unexploited resource of SNPs in numerous individuals from different populations. SNP detection by RNA-seq is particularly interesting for livestock species since whole genome sequencing is expensive and exome sequencing tools are unavailable. These SNPs detected in expressed regions can be used to characterize variants affecting protein functions, and to study cis-regulated genes by analyzing allele-specific expression (ASE) in the tissue of interest. However, gene expression can be highly variable, and filters for SNP detection using the popular GATK toolkit are not yet standardized, making SNP detection and genotype calling by RNA-seq a challenging endeavor. We compared SNP calling results using GATK suggested filters, on two chicken populations for which both RNA-seq and DNA-seq data were available for the same samples of the same tissue. We showed, in expressed regions, a RNA-seq precision of 91\% (SNPs detected by RNA-seq and shared by DNA-seq) and we characterized the remaining 9\% of SNPs. We then studied the genotype (GT) obtained by RNA-seq and the impact of two factors (GT call-rate and read number per GT) on the concordance of GT with DNA-seq; we proposed thresholds for them leading to a 95\% concordance. Applying these thresholds to 767 multi-tissue RNA-seq of 382 birds of 11 chicken populations, we found 9.5 M SNPs in total, of which ∼550,000 SNPs per tissue and population with a reliable GT (call rate ≥ 50\%) and among them, ∼340,000 with a MAF ≥ 10\%. We showed that such RNA-seq data from one tissue can be used to (i) detect SNPs with a strong predicted impact on proteins, despite their scarcity in each population (16,307 SIFT deleterious missenses and 590 stop-gained), (ii) study, on a large scale, cis-regulations of gene expression, with ∼81\% of protein-coding and 68\% of long non-coding genes (TPM ≥ 1) that can be analyzed for ASE, and with ∼29\% of them that were cis-regulated, and (iii) analyze population genetic using such SNPs located in expressed regions.

Another approach infers gene tree topologies separately and combines the individual estimates in order to explicitly model this heterogeneity. Here we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches-using the gene trees singly or in concatenation-paying special attention to the sources of variance and implicit assumptions. We make it clear that all methods are likely to have their assumptions violated, though the consequence of these violations differs in different parts of parameter space. The main conclusion of our review is that different sources of error are more or less important in different settings, such that phylogenetics researchers should be using the methods most appropriate to their problems rather than stick to one dogmatically.},

However, little attention has been given to how ecologically relevant field conditions may affect gene expression during diapause development because previous studies have focused on laboratoryreared and -maintained insects. To determine whether gene expression differs between laboratory and field conditions, prepupae of the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, entering diapause early or late in the growing season were collected. These two groups were further subdivided in early autumn into laboratory- and field-maintained groups, resulting in four experimental treatments of diapausing prepupae: early and late field, and early and late laboratory. RNA-seq and differential expression analyses were performed on bees from the four treatment groups in November, January, March and May. The number of treatment-specific differentially expressed genes (97 to 1249) outnumbered the number of differentially regulated genes common to all four treatments (14 to 229), indicating that exposure to laboratory or field conditions had a major impact on gene expression during diapause development. Principle component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis yielded similar grouping of treatments, confirming that the treatments form distinct clusters. Our results support the conclusion that gene expression during the course of diapause development is not a simple ordered sequence, but rather a highly plastic response determined primarily by the environmental history of the individual insect.},

	abstract = {Ubiquitous in eukaryotes, circular RNAs (circRNAs) comprise a large class of mostly non-coding RNAs produced by back-splicing. Although some circRNAs have demonstrated biochemical activities, whether most circRNAs are functional is unknown. Here, we test the hypothesis that circRNA production primarily results from splicing error and so is deleterious instead of beneficial. In support of the error hypothesis, our analysis of RNA sequencing data from 11 shared tissues of humans, macaques, and mice finds that (1) back-splicing is much rarer than linear-splicing, (2) the rate of back-splicing diminishes with the splicing amount, (3) the overall prevalence of back-splicing in a species declines with its effective population size, and (4) circRNAs are overall evolutionarily unconserved. We estimate that more than 97\% of the observed circRNA production is deleterious. We identify a small number of functional circRNA candidates, and the genome-wide trend strongly suggests that circRNAs are largely non-functional products of splicing errors., 

, Circular RNAs (circRNAs) comprise a large class of mostly non-coding RNAs generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, but the biological functions of circRNAs are largely unknown. Xu and Zhang provide evidence that most mammalian circRNAs are products of splicing errors and likely do not confer benefits.},

	abstract = {Alternative translation initiation (ATLI) refers to the existence of multiple translation initiation sites per gene and is a widespread phenomenon in eukaryotes. ATLI is commonly assumed to be advantageous through creating proteome diversity or regulating protein synthesis. We here propose an alternative hypothesis that ATLI arises primarily from nonadaptive initiation errors presumably due to the limited ability of ribosomes to distinguish sequence motifs truly signaling translation initiation from similar sequences. Our hypothesis, but not the adaptive hypothesis, predicts a series of global patterns of ATLI, all of which are confirmed at the genomic scale by quantitative translation initiation sequencing in multiple human and mouse cell lines and tissues. Similarly, although many codons differing from AUG by one nucleotide can serve as start codons, our analysis suggests that using non-AUG start codons is mostly disadvantageous. These and other findings strongly suggest that ATLI predominantly results from molecular error, requiring a major revision of our understanding of the precision and regulation of translation initiation.},

I propose that, when phenotypic traits are stratified according to a hierarchy of biological organization, the fraction of evolutionary changes in phenotype that are adaptive rises with the phenotypic level considered. Consistently, molecular traits are frequently found to evolve neutrally whereas a large, random set of organismal traits were recently reported to vary largely adaptively. Many more studies of unbiased samples of phenotypic traits are needed to test the general validity of this hypothesis.},

Because of its potential role in expanding protein diversity, interest in alternative splicing has been increasing over the last decade. Although recent studies have shown that 94\% human multiexon genes undergo AS, evolution of AS and thus its potential role in functional innovation in eukaryotic genomes remain largely unexplored. Here we review available evidence regarding the evolution of AS prevalence and functional role. In addition we stress the need to correct for the strong effect of transcript coverage in AS detection and set out a strategy to ultimately elucidate the extent of the role of AS in functional innovation on a genomic scale.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) of precursor RNAs is responsible for greatly expanding the regulatory and functional capacity of eukaryotic genomes. Of the different classes of AS, intron retention (IR) is the least well understood. In plants and unicellular eukaryotes, IR is the most common form of AS, whereas in animals, it is thought to represent the least prevalent form. Using high-coverage poly(A)(+) RNA-seq data, we observe that IR is surprisingly frequent in mammals, affecting transcripts from as many as three-quarters of multiexonic genes. A highly correlated set of cis features comprising an "IR code" reliably discriminates retained from constitutively spliced introns. We show that IR acts widely to reduce the levels of transcripts that are less or not required for the physiology of the cell or tissue type in which they are detected. This "transcriptome tuning" function of IR acts through both nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and nuclear sequestration and turnover of IR transcripts. We further show that IR is linked to a cross-talk mechanism involving localized stalling of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and reduced availability of spliceosomal components. Collectively, the results implicate a global checkpoint-type mechanism whereby reduced recruitment of splicing components coupled to Pol II pausing underlies widespread IR-mediated suppression of inappropriately expressed transcripts.},

Trait science needs a vision for achieving global integration across all organisms. Here, we outline how the adoption of key Open Science principles—open data, open source and open methods—is transforming trait science, increasing transparency, democratizing access and accelerating global synthesis. To enhance widespread adoption of these principles, we introduce the Open Traits Network (OTN), a global, decentralized community welcoming all researchers and institutions pursuing the collaborative goal of standardizing and integrating trait data across organisms. We demonstrate how adherence to Open Science principles is key to the OTN community and outline five activities that can accelerate the synthesis of trait data across the Tree of Life, thereby facilitating rapid advances to address scientific inquiries and environmental issues. Lessons learned along the path to a global synthesis of trait data will provide a framework for addressing similarly complex data science and informatics challenges.},

	abstract = {Selection pressures on proteins are usually measured by comparing homologous nucleotide sequences (Zuckerkandl and Pauling 1965). Recently we introduced a novel method, termed volatility, to estimate selection pressures on proteins on the basis of their synonymous codon usage (Plotkin and Dushoﬀ 2003; Plotkin et al. 2004). Here we provide a theoretical foundation for this approach. Under the Fisher-Wright model, we derive the expected frequencies of synonymous codons as a function of the strength of selection on amino acids, the mutation rate, and the eﬀective population size. We analyze the conditions under which we can expect to draw inferences from biased codon usage, and we estimate the time scales required to establish and maintain such a signal. We ﬁnd that synonymous codon usage can reliably distinguish between negative selection and neutrality only for organisms, such as some microbes, that experience large eﬀective population sizes or periods of elevated mutation rates. The power of volatility to detect positive selection is also modest—requiring approximately 100 selected sites—but it depends less strongly on population size. We show that phenomena such as transient hyper-mutators can improve the power of volatility to detect selection, even when the neutral site heterozygosity is low. We also discuss several confounding factors, neglected by the Fisher-Wright model, that may limit the applicability of volatility in practice.},

	abstract = {The Ranavirus (one genus of Iridovidae family) is an emerging pathogen that infects fish, amphibian, and reptiles, and causes great economical loss and ecological threat to farmed and wild animals globally. The major capsid protein (MCP) has been used as genetic typing marker and as target to design vaccines. Herein, the codon usage pattern of 73 MCP genes of Ranavirus and Lymphocystivirus are studied by calculating effective number of codons (ENC), relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), codon adaptation index (CAI), and relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI), and similarity index (SiD). The Ranavirus are confirmed to be classified into five groups by using phylogenetic analysis, and varied nucleotide compositions and hierarchical cluster analysis based on RSCU. The results revealed different codon usage patterns among Lymphocystivirus and five groups of Ranavirus. Ranavirus had six over-represented codons ended with G/C nucleotide, while Lymphocystivirus had six over-represented codons ended with A/T nucleotide. A comparative analysis of parameters that define virus and host relatedness in terms of codon usage were analyzed indicated that Amphibian-like ranaviruses (ALRVs) seem to possess lower ENC values and higher CAIs in contrast to other ranaviruses isolated from fishes, and two groups (FV3-like and CMTV-like group) of them had received higher selection pressure from their hosts as having higher relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI) and similarity index (SiD). The correspondence analysis (COA) and Spearman's rank correlation analyses revealed that nucleotide compositions, relative dinucleotide frequency, mutation pressure, and natural translational selection shape the codon usage pattern in MCP genes and the ENC-GC3S and neutrality plots indicated that the natural selection is the predominant factor. These results contribute to understanding the evolution of Ranavirus and their adaptions to their hosts.},

These patterns have been inferred to reflect the action of natural selection. Here we evaluate this in bacteria. While intragenomic variation in many species is consistent with selection favouring translationally optimal codons, much of the variation among species appears to be due to biased patterns of mutation. The strength of selection on codon usage can be estimated by two different approaches. First, the extent of bias in favour of translationally optimal codons in highly expressed genes, compared to that in genes where selection is weak, reveals the long-term effectiveness of selection. Here we show that the strength of selected codon usage bias is highly correlated with bacterial growth rate, suggesting that selection has favoured translational efficiency. Second, the pattern of bias towards optimal codons at polymorphic sites reveals the ongoing action of selection. Using this approach we obtained results that were completely consistent with the first method; importantly, the frequency spectra of optimal codons at polymorphic sites were similar to those predicted under an equilibrium model. Highly expressed genes in Escherichia coli appear to be under continuing strong selection, whereas selection is very weak in genes expressed at low levels.},

               Continuity of care has been monitored rarely in Italian community mental health centres.
            
            
               Aims
               To estimate the long-term probability of leaving care in first-contact patients attending an out-patient service, and to identify patients most likely to drop out.
            
            
               Method
               All patients who had a first contact with the community mental health centre of Magenta during a 1-year recruitment period were followed up for 24 months. Patients who failed to return after the last out-patient visit were regarded as ‘drop-outs'.
            
            
               Results
               During the 1-year recruitment period 330 subjects were at their first contact. The 1-year incidence of first-contact patients was nearly 33 per 10 000 inhabitants. At follow-up, 46\% of patients had dropped out. In comparison with patients with psychoses, subjects suffering from neurotic (P=0.004) and personality disorders (P=0.029) were more likely to drop out.
            
            
               Conclusions
               In the Italian system of community psychiatric care nearly half of the patients are no longer in contact after 2 years. Those who stay in treatment are more likely to suffer from psychosis, suggesting a commitment of Italian outpatient facilities to tackling the needs of patients with more severe disorders.},

To date, detection of translational selection in vertebrates has proven to be a challenging task, obscured by small long-term effective population sizes in larger animals and the existence of isochores in some species. The consensus is that, in such species, natural selection is either completely ineffective at overcoming mutational pressures and genetic drift or perhaps is effective but so weak that it is not detectable. The aim of this research is to understand the interplay between mutation, selection, and genetic drift in vertebrates. We observe that although variation in mutational bias is undoubtedly the dominant force influencing codon usage, translational selection acts as a weak additional factor influencing synonymous codon usage. These observations indicate that translational selection is a widespread phenomenon in vertebrates and is not limited to a few species.},

To elucidate the mechanisms by which the translational machinery adapts to such changes, we perturbed the tRNA pool of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by tRNA gene deletion. We then evolved the deletion strain and observed that the genetic adaptation was recurrently based on a strategic mutation that changed the anticodon of other tRNA genes to match that of the deleted one. Strikingly, a systematic search in hundreds of genomes revealed that anticodon mutations occur throughout the tree of life. We further show that the evolution of the tRNA pool also depends on the need to properly couple translation to protein folding. Together, our observations shed light on the evolution of the tRNA pool, demonstrating that mutation in the anticodons of tRNA genes is a common adaptive mechanism when meeting new translational demands.

This repertoire of molecular decoders is positioned in the crossroad of the genome, the transcriptome, and the proteome. Omics and systems biology now allow scientists to explore the entire repertoire of tRNAs of many organisms, revealing basic exciting biology. The tRNA gene set of hundreds of species is now characterized, in addition to the tRNA genes of organelles and viruses. Genes encoding tRNAs for certain anticodon types appear in dozens of copies in a genome, while others are universally absent from any genome. Transcriptome measurement of tRNAs is challenging, but in recent years new technologies have allowed researchers to determine the dynamic expression patterns of tRNAs. These advances reveal that availability of ready-to-translate tRNA molecules is highly controlled by several transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory processes. This regulation shapes the proteome according to the cellular state. The tRNA pool profoundly impacts many aspects of cellular and organismal life, including protein expression level, translation accuracy, adequacy of folding, and even mRNA stability. As a result, the shape of the tRNA pool affects organismal health and may participate in causing conditions such as cancer and neurological conditions.},

Determining which transcripts produce biologically important isoforms is key to understanding isoform function and to interpreting the real impact of somatic mutations and germline variations. Here we have developed a method, TRIFID, to classify the functional importance of splice isoforms. TRIFID was trained on isoforms detected in large-scale proteomics analyses and distinguishes these biologically important splice isoforms with high confidence. Isoforms predicted as functionally important by the algorithm had measurable cross species conservation and significantly fewer broken functional domains. Additionally, exons that code for these functionally important protein isoforms are under purifying selection, while exons from low scoring transcripts largely appear to be evolving neutrally. TRIFID has been developed for the human genome, but it could in principle be applied to other well-annotated species. We believe that this method will generate valuable insights into the cellular importance of alternative splicing.},

We examined tRNA gene copy number variation (tgCNV) in six individuals; two kindreds of two parents and a child, using high coverage whole genome sequence data. Such differences may be important because translation of some mRNAs is sensitive to the relative amounts of tRNAs and because tRNA competition determines translational efficiency vs. fidelity and production of native vs. misfolded proteins. We identified several tRNA gene clusters with CNV, which in some cases were part of larger iterations. In addition there was an isolated tRNALysCUU gene that was absent as a homozygous deletion in one of the parents. When assessed by semiquantitative PCR in 98 DNA samples representing a wide variety of ethnicities, this allele was found deleted in hetero- or homozygosity in all groups at {\textasciitilde}50\% frequency. This is the first report of copy number variation of human tRNA genes.

	abstract = {Background
Alternative splicing, which generates multiple mRNA isoforms from single genes, is crucial for the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. The flux through competing splicing pathways cannot be determined by traditional RNA-Seq, however, because different mRNA isoforms can have widely differing decay rates. Indeed, some mRNA isoforms with extremely short half-lives, such as those subject to translation-dependent nonsense-mediated decay (AS-NMD), may be completely overlooked in even the most extensive RNA-Seq analyses.

Results
RNA immunoprecipitation in tandem (RIPiT) of exon junction complex components allows for purification of post-splicing mRNA-protein particles (mRNPs) not yet subject to translation (pre-translational mRNPs) and, therefore, translation-dependent mRNA decay. Here we compare exon junction complex RIPiT-Seq to whole cell RNA-Seq data from HEK293 cells. Consistent with expectation, the flux through known AS-NMD pathways is substantially higher than that captured by RNA-Seq. Our RIPiT-Seq also definitively demonstrates that the splicing machinery itself has no ability to detect reading frame. We identify thousands of previously unannotated splicing events; while many can be attributed to splicing noise, others are evolutionarily conserved events that produce new AS-NMD isoforms likely involved in maintenance of protein homeostasis. Several of these occur in genes whose overexpression has been linked to poor cancer prognosis.

Conclusions
Deep sequencing of RNAs in post-splicing, pre-translational mRNPs provides a means to identify and quantify splicing events without the confounding influence of differential mRNA decay. For many known AS-NMD targets, the nonsense-mediated decay-linked alternative splicing pathway predominates. Exon junction complex RIPiT-Seq also revealed numerous conserved but previously unannotated AS-NMD events.},

Dysregulation of the splicing process has been implicated in a vast repertoire of diseases. However, splicing has recently been linked to both the aging process itself and pro-longevity interventions. This review focuses on recent research towards defining RNA splicing as a new hallmark of aging. We highlight dysfunctional alternative splicing events that contribute to the aging phenotype across multiple species, along with recent efforts toward deciphering mechanistic roles for RNA splicing in the regulation of aging and longevity. Further, we discuss recent research demonstrating a direct requirement for specific splicing factors in pro-longevity interventions, and specifically how nutrient signaling pathways interface to splicing factor regulation and downstream splicing targets. Finally, we review the emerging potential of using splicing profiles as a predictor of biological age and life expectancy. Understanding the role of RNA splicing components and downstream targets altered in aging may provide opportunities to develop therapeutics and ultimately extend healthy lifespan in humans.},

A unique feature and major strength of SURVIV is that it models the measurement uncertainty of mRNA isoform ratio in RNA-seq data. Simulation studies suggest that SURVIV outperforms the conventional Cox regression survival analysis, especially for data sets with modest sequencing depth. We applied SURVIV to TCGA RNA-seq data of invasive ductal carcinoma as well as five additional cancer types. Alternative splicing-based survival predictors consistently outperform gene expression-based survival predictors, and the integration of clinical, gene expression and alternative splicing profiles leads to the best survival prediction. We anticipate that SURVIV will have broad utilities for analysing diverse types of mRNA isoform variation in large-scale clinical RNA-seq projects.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) is a key regulatory mechanism for the development of different tissues; however, not much is known about changes to alternative splicing during aging. Splicing events may become more frequent and widespread genome-wide as tissues age and the splicing machinery stringency decreases. Using skin, skeletal muscle, bone, thymus, and white adipose tissue from wild-type C57BL6/J male mice (4 and 18 months old), we examined the effect of age on splicing by AS analysis of the differential exon usage of the genome. The results identified a considerable number of AS genes in skeletal muscle, thymus, bone, and white adipose tissue between the different age groups (ranging from 27 to 246 AS genes corresponding to 0.3–3.2\% of the total number of genes analyzed). For skin, skeletal muscle, and bone, we included a later age group (28 months old) that showed that the number of alternatively spliced genes increased with age in all three tissues (P {\textless} 0.01). Analysis of alternatively spliced genes across all tissues by gene ontology and pathway analysis identified 158 genes involved in RNA processing. Additional analysis of AS in a mouse model for the premature aging disease Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome was performed. The results show that expression of the mutant protein, progerin, is associated with an impaired developmental splicing. As progerin accumulates, the number of genes with AS increases compared to in wild-type skin. Our results indicate the existence of a mechanism for increased AS during aging in several tissues, emphasizing that AS has a more important role in the aging process than previously known.},

Interventions that attenuate or reverse systemic dysfunction seen with age therefore have potential to reduce overall disease risk in the elderly. Pre-mRNA splicing is a fundamental link between gene expression and the proteome, and deregulation of the splicing machinery is linked to multiple age-related chronic diseases,. However, the role of splicing homeostasis in healthy ageing remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that pre-mRNA splicing homeostasis is a biomarker and predictor of life expectancy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using transcriptomics and in-depth splicing analysis in young and old animals fed ad libitum or on dietary restriction (DR), we find defects in global pre-mRNA splicing with age that are reduced by DR via the branch point binding protein (BBP)/splicing factor 1 (SFA-1). We show that SFA-1 is specifically required for lifespan extension both by DR, and modulation of TORC1 pathway components AMPK, RAGA-1 and RSKS-1/S6 Kinase. Lastly, we demonstrate that overexpression of SFA-1 is sufficient to extend lifespan. Together, these data demonstrate a role for RNA splicing homeostasis in DR longevity and suggest modulation of specific spliceosome components can prolong healthy ageing.},

However, it remains unclear whether IR undergoes spatial or temporal changes during different stages of aging or neurodegeneration like Alzheimer's disease (AD). By profiling the transcriptome of Drosophila head cells at different ages, we observed a significant increase in IR events for many genes during aging. Differential IR affects distinct biological functions at different ages and occurs at several AD‐associated genes in older adults. The increased nucleosome occupancy at the differentially retained introns in young animals suggests that it may regulate the level of IR during aging. Notably, an increase in the number of IR events was also observed in healthy older mouse and human brain tissues, as well as in the cerebellum and frontal cortex from independent AD cohorts. Genes with differential IR shared many common features, including shorter intron length, no perturbation in their mRNA level, and enrichment for biological functions that are associated with mRNA processing and proteostasis. The differentially retained introns identified in AD frontal cortex have higher GC content, with many of their mRNA transcripts showing an altered level of protein expression compared to control samples. Taken together, our results suggest that an increased IR is an conserved signature that is associated with aging. By affecting pathways involved in mRNA and protein homeostasis, changes of IR pattern during aging may regulate the transition from healthy to pathological state in late‐onset sporadic AD.},

We identify 1,464 loci associated with variation in isoform usage (sQTLs), 9\% of them being stimulation-specific, which are enriched in disease-related loci. Furthermore, we detect a longstanding increased plasticity of immune gene splicing, and show that positive selection and Neanderthal introgression have both contributed to diversify the splicing landscape of human populations. Together, these findings suggest that differential isoform usage has been an important substrate of innovation in the long-term evolution of immune responses and a more recent vehicle of population local adaptation.},

By reporting the presence of 5-meC in a broad variety of wild, laboratory, and industrial yeasts, a recent study also challenged the dogma about the absence of DNA methylation in yeast species. We would like to bring to attention that the protocol used for gas chromatography/mass spectrometry involved hydrolysis of the DNA preparations. As this process separates cytosine and 5-meC from the sugar phosphate backbone, this method is unable to distinguish DNA- from RNA-derived 5-meC. We employed an alternative LC–MS/MS protocol where by targeting 5-methyldeoxycytidine moieties after enzymatic digestion, only 5-meC specifically derived from DNA is quantified. This technique unambiguously identified cytosine DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana (14.0\% of cytosines methylated), Mus musculus (7.6\%), and Escherichia coli (2.3\%). Despite achieving a detection limit at 250 attomoles (corresponding to {\textless}0.00002 methylated cytosines per nonmethylated cytosine), we could not confirm any cytosine DNA methylation in laboratory and industrial strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces boulardii, Saccharomyces paradoxus, or Pichia pastoris. The protocol however unequivocally confirmed DNA methylation in adult Drosophila melanogaster at a value (0.034\%) that is up to 2 orders of magnitude below the detection limit of bisulphite sequencing. Thus, 5-meC is a rare DNA modification in drosophila but absent in yeast.},

At the population genetics level, low effective population size and reduced efficiency of purifying selection have been suggested as an evolutionary consequence of both social life and parasitism. In this study, we tested these hypotheses by estimating the relative rate of non-synonymous substitution in 169 species to investigate the variation in natural selection efficiency and effective population size throughout the Hymenoptera tree of life. We found no effect of parasitism, but show that relaxed selection is associated with eusociality, suggesting that the division of reproductive labour decreases effective population size in ants, bees and wasps. Unexpectedly, the effect of eusociality is marginal compared to a striking and widespread relaxation of selection in both social and non social bees, which indicates that these keystone pollinator species generally feature low effective population sizes. Albeit strong, this widespread pattern in pollinating bees is difficult to clearly explain, but might suggest links between drops of effective population size and evolution of social life, as bees are the Hymenoptera group with the most appearances of eusociality in the tree of life. The particularly high load of deleterious mutations we report in the genome of these crucial ecosystem engineer species also raises new concerns about their ongoing population decline.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we report the transcriptomes of seven organs (cerebrum, cerebellum, heart, kidney, liver, ovary and testis) across developmental time points from early organogenesis to adulthood for human, rhesus macaque, mouse, rat, rabbit, opossum and chicken. Comparisons of gene expression patterns identified correspondences of developmental stages across species, and differences in the timing of key events during the development of the gonads. We found that the breadth of gene expression and the extent of purifying selection gradually decrease during development, whereas the amount of positive selection and expression of new genes increase. We identified differences in the temporal trajectories of expression of individual genes across species, with brain tissues showing the smallest percentage of trajectory changes, and the liver and testis showing the largest. Our work provides a resource of developmental transcriptomes of seven organs across seven species, and comparative analyses that characterize the development and evolution of mammalian organs.},

A rice alternatively spliced transcript detection microarray (ASDM) and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) were applied to differentiate the transcriptome of 4 representative organs of Oryza sativa L. cv. Ilmi: leaves, roots, 1-cm-stage panicles and young seeds at 21 days after pollination. Comparison of data obtained by microarray and RNA-Seq showed a bell-shaped distribution and a co-lineation for highly expressed genes. Transcripts were classified according to the degree of organ enrichment using a coefficient value (CV, the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean values): highly variable (CVI), variable (CVII), and constitutive (CVIII) groups. A higher index of the portion of loci with alternatively spliced transcripts in a group (IAST) value was observed for the constitutive group. Genes of the highly variable group showed the characteristics of the examined organs, and alternatively spliced transcripts tended to exhibit the same organ specificity or less organ preferences, with avoidance of ‘organ distinctness’. In addition, within a locus, a tendency of higher expression was found for transcripts with a longer coding sequence (CDS), and a spliced intron was the most commonly found type of alternative splicing for an extended CDS. Thus, pre-mRNA splicing might have evolved to retain maximum functionality in terms of organ preference and multiplicity.},

	abstract = {It is widely assumed that our mammalian ancestors, which lived in the Cretaceous era, were tiny animals that survived massive
asteroid impacts in shelters and evolved into modern forms after dinosaurs went extinct, 65 Ma. The small size of most Mesozoic
mammalian fossils essentially supports this view. Paleontology, however, is not conclusive regarding the ancestry of extant
mammals, because Cretaceous and Paleocene fossils are not easily linked to modern lineages. Here, we use full-genome data
to estimate the longevity and body mass of early placental mammals. Analyzing 36 fully sequenced mammalian genomes, we reconstruct
two aspects of the ancestral genome dynamics, namely GC-content evolution and nonsynonymous over synonymous rate ratio. Linking
these molecular evolutionary processes to life-history traits in modern species, we estimate that early placental mammals
had a life span above 25 years and a body mass above 1 kg. This is similar to current primates, cetartiodactyls, or carnivores,
but markedly different from mice or shrews, challenging the dominant view about mammalian origin and evolution. Our results
imply that long-lived mammals existed in the Cretaceous era and were the most successful in evolution, opening new perspectives
about the conditions for survival to the Cretaceous–Tertiary crisis.},

	abstract = {Background
The ratio of the rates of non-synonymous and synonymous substitution (dN/dS) is commonly used to estimate selection in coding sequences. It is often suggested that, all else being equal, dN/dS should be lower in populations with large effective size (Ne) due to increased efficacy of purifying selection. As Ne is difficult to measure directly, life history traits such as body mass, which is typically negatively associated with population size, have commonly been used as proxies in empirical tests of this hypothesis. However, evidence of whether the expected positive correlation between body mass and dN/dS is consistently observed is conflicting.

Results
Employing whole genome sequence data from 48 avian species, we assess the relationship between rates of molecular evolution and life history in birds. We find a negative correlation between dN/dS and body mass, contrary to nearly neutral expectation. This raises the question whether the correlation might be a method artefact. We therefore in turn consider non-stationary base composition, divergence time and saturation as possible explanations, but find no clear patterns. However, in striking contrast to dN/dS, the ratio of radical to conservative amino acid substitutions (Kr/Kc) correlates positively with body mass.

Conclusions
Our results in principle accord with the notion that non-synonymous substitutions causing radical amino acid changes are more efficiently removed by selection in large populations, consistent with nearly neutral theory. These findings have implications for the use of dN/dS and suggest that caution is warranted when drawing conclusions about lineage-specific modes of protein evolution using this metric.

CaMKII is encoded by four genes in humans, all of which undergo alternative splicing at the RNA level, leading to an enormous diversity of expressed proteins. Advances in sequencing technologies have facilitated the discovery of many new CaMKII transcripts. To date, newly discovered CaMKII transcripts have been incorporated into an ambiguous naming scheme. Herein, we review the initial experiments leading to the discovery of CaMKII and its subsequent variants. We propose the adoption of a new, unambiguous naming scheme for CaMKII variants. Finally, we discuss biological implications for CaMKII splice variants.},

Recent literature has revealed that the deregulation of RNA modifications can promote a plethora of developmental diseases, including tumorigenesis. In this review, we will focus on four key post-transcriptional RNA modifications which have been identified as contributors to the pathogenesis of brain tumors: m6A, alternative polyadenylation, alternative splicing and adenosine to inosine modifications. In addition to the role of RNA modifications in brain tumor progression, we will also discuss potential opportunities to target these processes to improve the dismal prognosis for brain tumors.},

	abstract = {A rapidly aging global population has motivated the development and use of models for human aging. Studies on aging have shown parallels between zebrafish and humans at the internal organization level; however, few parallels have been studied at the whole-organism level. Furthermore, the effectiveness of exercise as a method to mitigate the effects of aging has not been studied in zebrafish. We investigated the effects of aging and intermittent exercise on swimming performance, kinematics and behavior. Young, middle-aged and old zebrafish (20–29, 36–48 and 60–71\% of average lifespan, respectively) were exercised to exhaustion in endurance and sprint swimming tests once a week for four weeks. Both endurance and sprint performance decreased with increased age. Swimming performance improved with exercise training in young and middle-aged zebrafish, but not in old zebrafish. Tail-beat amplitude, which is akin to stride length in humans, increased for all age groups with training. Zebrafish turning frequency, which is an indicator of routine activity, decreased with age but showed no change with exercise. In sum, our results show that zebrafish exhibit a decline in whole-organism performance and trainability with age. These findings closely resemble the senescence-related declines in physical ability experienced by humans and mammalian aging models and therefore support the use of zebrafish as a model for human exercise and aging.},

	abstract = {The increasing frailty that accompanies old age deeply influences our lives and permeates our thoughts. As a result, studies tackling this topic naturally fascinate both specialists and the general public. However, despite a wealth of research, the fundamental mechanisms of aging remain undetermined. Damage to molecules, such as DNA and proteins that are essential for life and proper organismal function, is a prime candidate for explaining the degeneration that accompanies aging (1). Much of the research into age-related DNA damage has focused on the damage caused by oxidative stress (2), but this is by no means the only potential source of disruption that can occur to DNA. A ground-breaking study in PNAS by Elsner et al. (3) leverages the remarkable natural differences in longevity found among termite castes to identify transposable element (TE) activity as a potential source of DNA damage that is elevated in older workers compared with the reproductive kings and queens.

TEs are genetic elements capable of moving around the genome and inserting themselves into new locations (4). These insertions can cause significant damage when they interrupt crucial sequences of DNA, such as protein coding sequences or regulatory regions, and are thus associated with mutation-based diseases, such as cancer (5). Because of these deleterious effects, the expression of TEs (which is required for their transposition) is usually suppressed by the cell machinery. However, this suppression is not complete (6) and TE activity increases with age, leading to an accumulation of TE-related damage in a range of species (6⇓–8).

While much research on aging focuses on humans and other mammals, important breakthroughs have come from …

However, more experimental animals are required to clarify the complex mechanisms behind the phenomena of aging and lifespan. In this study, we reported the variation of lifespan in nine distinct silkworm strains. Lifespan correlated significantly with BmFoxO gene expression in the representative silkworm strains tested (Xiafang, Dazao-N, and N4). In general, the female silkworm was longer lived than the male of the same strain. Dietary restriction extended the silkworm lifespan compared with that of silkworms fed ad libitum. The expression of BmFoxO was significantly elevated in the dietary restriction group on day 3 of the 4th instar and day 3 of the 5th instar, suggesting that BmFoxO contributes to dietary restriction-mediated lifespan extension. The RNA interference and overexpression of the BmFoxO gene significantly shortened and extended the silkworm adulthood, respectively. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the silkworm might serve as a promising experimental animal to explore the complex biological mechanisms of lifespan determination.},

The most common ALCB management practice is the loose cell system, in which cocooned bees are removed from nesting cavities for cleaning and storage. Traits of ALCBs that favored their commercialization include gregarious nesting; use of leaves for lining nests; ready acceptance of affordable, mass-produced nesting materials; alfalfa pollination efﬁcacy; and emergence synchrony with alfalfa bloom. The ALCB became a commercial success because much of its natural history was understood, targeted research was pursued, and producer ingenuity was encouraged.

	copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sawfly&oldid=951296133},
	abstract = {Sawflies are the insects of the suborder Symphyta within the order Hymenoptera alongside ants, bees and wasps. The common name comes from the saw-like appearance of the ovipositor, which the females use to cut into the plants where they lay their eggs. The name is associated especially with the Tenthredinoidea, by far the largest superfamily, with about 7,000 known species; in the entire suborder, there are 8,000 described species in more than 800 genera. The suborder Symphyta is paraphyletic, consisting of several basal groups within the order Hymenoptera.
The primary distinction between sawflies and their relatives the Apocrita – the ants, bees, and wasps – is that the adults lack a "wasp waist", and instead have a broad connection between the abdomen and the thorax. Some sawflies are Batesian mimics of wasps and bees, and the ovipositor can be mistaken for a stinger. Sawflies vary in length, most measuring 2.5 millimetres (0.1 in) to 20 millimetres (0.8 in); the largest known sawfly measured 55 millimetres (2.2 in). The larvae are caterpillar-like, but can be distinguished by the number of prolegs and the absence of crochets in sawfly larvae. The great majority of sawflies are plant-eating, though the members of the superfamily Orussoidea are parasitic.
Predators include birds, insects and small animals. The larvae of some species have anti-predator adaptations such as regurgitating irritating liquid and clustering together for safety in numbers. Sawflies are hosts to many parasitoids, most of which are Hymenoptera, the rest being Diptera.
Adult sawflies are short-lived, with a life expectancy of 7–9 days, though the larval stage can last from months to years, depending on the species. Parthenogenetic females, which do not need to mate to produce fertilised eggs, are common in the suborder, though many species have males. The adults feed on pollen, nectar, honeydew, sap, other insects, including hemolymph of the larvae hosts; they have mouth pieces adapated to these types of feeding.Sawflies go through a complete metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. The female uses her ovipositor to drill into plant material (or, in the case of Orussoidea, other insects) and then lays eggs in groups called rafts or pods. After hatching, larvae feed on plants, often in groups. As they approach adulthood, the larvae seek a protected spot to pupate, typically in bark or the soil. Large populations of species such as the pine sawfly can cause substantial damage to economic forestry, while others such as the iris sawfly are important pests in horticulture. Outbreaks of sawfly larvae can defoliate trees and may cause dieback, stunting or death. Sawflies can be controlled through the use of insecticides, natural predators and parasites, or mechanical methods.
Sawflies first appeared 250 million years ago in the Triassic. The oldest superfamily, the Xyeloidea, has existed into the present. Over 200 million years ago, a lineage of sawflies evolved a parasitoid lifestyle, with carnivorous larvae that ate the eggs or larvae of other insects. Sawflies are distributed globally, though they are more diverse in the northern hemisphere.},

	shorttitle = {Régulation des bio-agresseurs dans les cultures associées de blé dur et de pois},
	url = {http://www.theses.fr/2012TOU30172},
	abstract = {Les pucerons font partie des principaux ravageurs des cultures dans les régions tempérées. Leur succès comme ravageurs des plantes repose sur leur fort potentiel reproductif dû à la parthénogenèse durant le printemps et l'été, la transmission des virus aux plantes et leur polyphénisme. Ce mode de multiplication asexué explique leur importante dynamique démographique et les dégâts causés sur les cultures. Plusieurs méthodes de lutte ont été envisagées à leur encontre, entre autre la régulation " Top-down ", qui est l'approche par les ennemis naturels, de la lutte chimique. Lorsqu'on compare les temps de développement des pucerons et leurs ennemis naturels, à l'instar des coccinelles, on constate que les premiers se développent plus vite que les seconds. C'est cette différence de vitesse de développement qui confère aux pucerons leur caractère de proie éphémère ou limitée dans le temps. Le calcul du rapport du temps de génération des prédateurs sur celui des pucerons, " Generation Time Ratio ", est supérieur à 1. Or, les rapports supérieurs à 1 correspondent à des relations trophiques défavorables à la mise en place d'une régulation " Top-down ". Dés lors, pour réguler les pucerons du pois, il faudrait envisager d'autres possibilités de lutte biologique. La voie " Bottom-up " semble ainsi être la plus appropriée. Cette approche par le "Bottom-up " privilégie l'augmentation de la biodiversité végétale en champ pour réguler la dynamique de population du puceron du pois. Le présent travail de thèse a pour objectif d'évaluer l'impact de la diversité végétale sur la démographie du puceron du pois (A. Pisum Harris) en monoculture de pois d'hiver par rapport à la culture associée de pois d'hiver et de blé dur. Au cours de nos travaux en champ, par des comptages de pucerons, nous avons pu ainsi vérifier que les infestations de pucerons étaient statistiquement plus élevées en monoculture de pois par rapport à la culture associée de pois d'hiver et de blé dur. Nous avons également pu évaluer l'influence de la plante-hôte sur les déplacements et l'aptitude des pucerons. Les déplacements et les paramètres démographiques d'A. Pisum adultes ont été examinés dans un peuplement pur de pois d'hiver et dans un peuplement mixte de pois d'hiver et de blé dur. Les distances parcourues en culture pure de pois sont significativement plus longues qu'en culture associée. Le taux de fécondité est plus élevé en culture associée de pois/blé qu'en culture pure de pois. De même, le taux de survie des larves est plus élevé en culture associée qu'en culture pure de pois même si la différence n'est pas significative. Nous avons, au cours de ce travail, testé sur 1036 pucerons leur choix sur les sources d'odeur entre deux types de cultures (monoculture de pois et une culture associée de blé dur au pois). A cela, nous avons ajouté d'autres paramètres tels que la forme du puceron (ailé ou aptère), la souche du puceron (sauvage ou élevé au laboratoire), la quantité de plante dans les pots lors de l'expérience. Le choix des pucerons selon le type de plante n'a pas montré des résultats significatifs. Cependant, on note une tendance des pucerons à choisir la source d'odeur chez la monoculture de pois. Ces résultats mettent en évidence l'importance de la diversité végétale sur la régulation des pucerons. Les effets liés à la plante hôte " Bottom- up " permettent de réguler certains ravageurs. Toutefois, d'autres variétés d'espèces de plantes dans le couple céréale-légumineuse devraient être testées afin de confirmer cette hypothèse.},

The longevity of field colonies was investigated in the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator (Jerdon) in which either reproductive workers (gamergates) or a single queen reproduce. 2. Data from 3 years were used to calculate the ratio between queen-right (n = 50) and gamergate (n = 12) colonies that can be used to derive the colony mortality of gamergate colonies. Using the survival rates of queens in the laboratory, extrinsic and intrinsic mortality rates of queen-right colonies were calculated. 3. No significant differences in the sizes of queen-right and gamergate colonies above 14 workers was found, suggesting that mortality of established colonies is not size related. 4. The mortality of gamergate colonies is 4.17 times higher than the intrinsic mortality of queen-right colonies. 5. In the laboratory, mean survival time of queens in colonies of more than 14 workers was 1.79 years. 6. Estimated mean survival time of queen-right and gamergate colonies in the field varies between 0.78 and 0.43 years respectively, when no costs of conflict during the replacement of queens occur; however, when the latter costs increase colony mortality to a level similar to extrinsic mortality, the calculated longevity of queen-right colonies would increase to 1.02 years.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. Field censuses and laboratory experiments show that in the Argentine ant, Iridomyrmex humilis (Mayr), c. 90\% of the queens are executed by workers in May, at the beginning of the reproductive season. The reduction in the number of queens probably decreases the inhibition exerted by queens on the differentiation of sexuals and thus allows the production of new queens and males shortly thereafter. In the laboratory, there was no correlation between the percentage of queens executed and their weight or fecundity. At the time of execution of queens, nearly all queens were of the same age; less than 1 year. Therefore it is not likely that the age of queens plays any role in the choice that workers make in the queens they executed. Execution of these queens results in a heavy energetic cost for the colony which amounts c. 8\% of the total biomass. This behaviour of workers executing nestmate queens is discussed with regard to possible evolutionary significance at the queen and worker level.},

We studied aging in a termite species, Cryptotermes secundus, which lives in less socially complex societies with a few hundred colony members. Reproductives develop from workers which are totipotent immatures. Comparing transcriptomes of young and old individuals, we found evidence for aging in reproductives that was especially associated with DNA and protein damage and the activity of transposable elements. By contrast, workers seemed to be better protected against aging. Thus our results differed from those obtained for social insects that live in more complex societies. Yet, they are in agreement with lifespan estimates for the study species. Our data are also in line with expectations from evolutionary theory. For individuals that are able to reproduce, it predicts that aging should only start after reaching maturity. As C. secundus workers are immatures with full reproductive options we expect them to invest into anti-aging processes. Our study illustrates that the degree of aging can differ between social insects and that it may be associated with caste-specific opportunities for reproduction.},

	abstract = {1 We report age-specific survivorship of founding kings and queens and colony age of first production of fertile progeny (alates) of two cohorts, containing 52 and 42 complete colonies, respectively, in the primitive dampwood termite Zootermopsis nevadensis ssp. nevadensis. 2 Longevity of kings and queens was determined and compared in various experimental manipulations of reproductive structure of incipient colonies (removal of king or queen or both vs. unmanipulated pairs as controls) performed one year after pairing. Life span of reproductives was also evaluated in circumstances of interactions between young colonies, a treatment inspired by field observations of natural nest spacing and intraspecific competition between young dampwood termite colonies. 3 In our first experimental series, founding pairs survived 2–7 years (x̄ = 4·5 ± 0·3 SE) after pairing. Kings lived significantly longer (x̄ = 4·7 ± 0·3 years after pairing; range 2·2–7·3 years) in treatments initiated as pairs than when left as the remaining founder in the queen removal treatment (x̄ = 3·2 ± 0·6 years after pairing; range 1·5–5·3 years), even though one or more female replacement reproductives differentiated within several months after queen loss. Queen life span in the absence of kings averaged 4·9 ± 0·4 years (range 3·6–6·3 years) after pairing, not significantly different from the life span of queens living with kings. There was no significant difference between king and queen life spans in non-interaction treatments in our first experiment. Results from the second experimental series (35 colonies) are presented to date. 4 Survival of pairs until death of one mate was significantly shorter in interaction treatments compared with control colonies, suggesting that intraspecific competition between young colonies may create opportunities for replacement reproductives. 5 The first alates were produced between 1·8 and 6·5 years after pairing in our first experimental series, and between 2·4 and 5 years, to date, in the second experiment. 6 Ecological and evolutionary correlates of long life span in social insect reproductives and other animals are discussed.},

Age-specific reproduction and age of death were monitored for 1200 adult males and 1200 females, each individually maintained on one of 12 diets from ad libitum to 30\% of ad libitum. Diet was provided in a fixed volume of solution that was fully consumed each day, ensuring control of total nutrient consumption for every fly. Contrary to expectation and precedence, increased longevity was not observed at any level of diet restriction. Among females, reproduction continued across all diet levels despite the cost in terms of increased mortality. Among males, life expectancy exceeded that of females at most diet levels. However, in both sexes, mortality increased more sharply and the pattern of survival changed abruptly once the diet level fell to 50\% of ad libitum or below, even though the energetic demands of egg production has no obvious counterpart in males. We believe that a more complete picture of the life table response to dietary restriction will emerge when studies are conducted on a wider range of species and include both sexes, more levels of diet, and the opportunity for mating and reproduction.},

	abstract = {We estimate colony reproductive success, in numbers of offspring colonies arising from a colony's daughter queens, of colonies of the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus. A measure of lifetime reproductive success is essential to understand the relation of ecological factors, phenotype and fitness in a natural population. This was possible for the first time in a natural population of ant colonies using data from long-term study of a population of colonies in south-eastern Arizona, for which ages of all colonies are known from census data collected since 1985. Parentage analyses of microsatellite data from 5 highly polymorphic loci were used to assign offspring colonies to maternal parent colonies in a population of about 265 colonies, ages 1–28 years, sampled in 2010. The estimated population growth rate Ro was 1·69 and generation time was 7·8 years. There was considerable variation among colonies in reproductive success: of 199 possible parent colonies, only 49 (˜ 25\%) had offspring colonies on the site. The mean number of offspring colonies per maternal parent colony was 2·94 and ranged from 1 to 8. A parent was identified for the queen of 146 of 247 offspring colonies. There was no evidence for reproductive senescence; fecundity was about the same throughout the 25–30 year lifespan of a colony. There were no trends in the distance or direction of the dispersal of an offspring relative to its maternal parent colony. There was no relationship between the number of gynes produced by a colony in 1 year and the number of offspring colonies subsequently founded by its daughter reproductive females. The results provide the first estimate of a life table for a population of ant colonies and the first estimate of the female component of colony lifetime reproductive success. The results suggest that commonly used measures of reproductive output may not be correlated with realized reproductive success. This is the starting point for future investigation asking whether variation in reproductive success is related to phenotypic variation among colonies in behavioural and ecological traits.},

They exhibit wide geographical distribution, high parasitism efﬁciency and easy laboratory rearing. Trichogramma pretiosum (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) have been successfully liberated in tomato crops in Brazil and thus, could be a promising biological control agent of the tomato fruit borer, Neoleucinodes elegantalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). Temperature is the main abiotic factor inﬂuencing biological aspects of the parasitoid. Knowledge of thermal requirements enables the relationship between temperature and development to be understood, the prediction of generation numbers in the ﬁeld, as well as the best time of parasitoids release. This study is the ﬁrst to access biological parameters and thermal requirements of T. pretiosum in N. elegantalis eggs. The duration of T. pretiosum development stages decreased as temperature increased. The parasitism rate differed among temperature ranges. At 28  C, 100\% of parasitoids emerged. The temperature did not affect sex ratio. Longevity showed an inverse relationship with temperature increases, ranging from 9.8 days at 18  C to 1.3 days at 33  C.

This is the first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the superfamily based on a molecular analysis of 18S and 28S ribosomal gene regions for 19 families, 72 subfamilies, 343 genera and 649 species. The 56 outgroups are comprised of Ceraphronoidea and most proctotrupomorph families, including Mymarommatidae. Data alignment and the impact of ambiguous regions are explored using a secondary structure analysis and automated (MAFFT) alignments of the core and pairing regions and regions of ambiguous alignment. Both likelihood and parsimony approaches are used to analyze the data. Overall there is no impact of alignment method, and few but substantial differences between likelihood and parsimony approaches. Monophyly of Chalcidoidea and a sister group relationship between Mymaridae and the remaining Chalcidoidea is strongly supported in all analyses. Either Mymarommatoidea or Diaprioidea are the sister group of Chalcidoidea depending on the analysis. Likelihood analyses place Rotoitidae as the sister group of the remaining Chalcidoidea after Mymaridae, whereas parsimony nests them within Chalcidoidea. Some traditional family groups are supported as monophyletic (Agaonidae, Eucharitidae, Encyrtidae, Eulophidae, Leucospidae, Mymaridae, Ormyridae, Signiphoridae, Tanaostigmatidae and Trichogrammatidae). Several other families are paraphyletic (Perilampidae) or polyphyletic (Aphelinidae, Chalcididae, Eupelmidae, Eurytomidae, Pteromalidae, Tetracampidae and Torymidae). Evolutionary scenarios discussed for Chalcidoidea include the evolution of phytophagy, egg parasitism, sternorrhynchan parasitism, hypermetamorphic development and heteronomy.},

Responses to major past environmental changes, such as the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution, or the development of major key innovations, such as wings or complete metamorphosis are usually invoked as potential evolutionary triggers. However this view is partially contradicted by studies on the family-level fossil record showing that insect diversification was relatively constant through time. In an attempt to reconcile both views, we investigate large-scale insect diversification dynamics at family level using two distinct types of diversification analyses on a molecular timetree representing ca. 82\% of the extant families and reassess the insect fossil diversity using up-to-date records. Analyses focusing on the fossil record recovered an early burst of diversification, declining to low and steady rates through time, interrupted by extinction events. Phylogenetic analyses showed that major shifts of diversification rates only occurred in the four richest holometabolous orders. Both suggest that neither the development of flight or complete metamorphosis nor the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution environmental changes induced immediate changes in diversification regimes; instead clade-specific innovations likely promoted the diversification of major insect orders.},

	doi = {10.1093/gbe/evz266},
	abstract = {Adaptation to a wide range of pathogenic environments is a major aspect of the ecological adaptations of vertebrates during evolution. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are ancient membrane-bound sensors in animals and are best known for their roles in detecting and defense against invading pathogenic microorganisms. To understand the evolutionary history of the vertebrate TLR gene family, we first traced the origin of single-cysteine cluster TLRs (sccTLRs) that share the same protein architecture with vertebrate TLRs in early-branching animals and then analyzed all members of the TLR family in over 200 species covering all major vertebrate clades. Our results indicate that although the emergence of sccTLRs predates the separation of bilaterians and cnidarians, most vertebrate TLR members originated shortly after vertebrate emergence. Phylogenetic analyses divided 1,726 vertebrate TLRs into eight subfamilies, and TLR3 may represent the most ancient subfamily that emerged before the branching of deuterostomes. Our analysis reveals that purifying selection predominated in the evolution of all vertebrate TLRs, with mean dN/dS (ω) values ranging from 0.082 for TLR21 in birds to 0.434 for TLR11 in mammals. However, we did observe patterns of positive selection acting on specific codons (527 of 60,294 codons across all vertebrate TLRs, 8.7‰), which are significantly concentrated in ligand-binding extracellular domains (ECDs) and suggest host-pathogen coevolutionary interactions. Additionally, we found stronger positive selection acting on nonviral compared to viral TLRs, indicating the more essential nonredundant function of viral TLRs in host immunity. Taken together, our findings provide comprehensive insight into the complex evolutionary processes of the vertebrate TLR gene family, involving gene duplication, pseudogenization, purification, and positive selection.},

Surprisingly, depletion of the ubiquitous Pol-II-associated transcription elongation factor SPT6 promotes a redistribution of H3K36me3 histone marks from active protein coding to lncRNA genes, which correlates with increased lncRNA transcription. SPT6 knockdown also impairs the recruitment of the Integrator complex to chromatin, which results in a transcriptional termination defect for lncRNA genes. This leads to the formation of extended, polyadenylated lncRNAs that are both chromatin restricted and form increased levels of RNA:DNA hybrid (R-loops) that are associated with DNA damage. Additionally, these deregulated lncRNAs overlap with DNA replication origins leading to localized DNA replication stress and a cellular senescence phenotype. Overall, our results underline the importance of restricting lncRNA expression.},

This is based on a range of nascent transcriptomic approaches applied to different nuclear fractions, including mammalian native elongating transcript sequencing (mNET-seq). Notably, mNET-seq patterns speciﬁc for different Pol II CTD phosphorylation states reveal weak co-transcriptional splicing and poly(A) signal-independent Pol II termination of lincRNAs as compared to pre-mRNAs. In addition, lincRNAs are mostly restricted to chromatin, since they are rapidly degraded by the RNA exosome.

	abstract = {Background
Most eukaryotic genes are subject to alternative splicing (AS), which may contribute to the production of protein variants or to the regulation of gene expression via nonsense-mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) decay (NMD). However, a fraction of splice variants might correspond to spurious transcripts and the question of the relative proportion of splicing errors to functional splice variants remains highly debated.

Results
We propose a test to quantify the fraction of AS events corresponding to errors. This test is based on the fact that the fitness cost of splicing errors increases with the number of introns in a gene and with expression level. We analyzed the transcriptome of the intron-rich eukaryote Paramecium tetraurelia. We show that in both normal and in NMD-deficient cells, AS rates strongly decrease with increasing expression level and with increasing number of introns. This relationship is observed for AS events that are detectable by NMD as well as for those that are not, which invalidates the hypothesis of a link with the regulation of gene expression. Our results show that in genes with a median expression level, 92–98\% of observed splice variants correspond to errors. We observed the same patterns in human transcriptomes and we further show that AS rates correlate with the fitness cost of splicing errors.

Conclusions
These observations indicate that genes under weaker selective pressure accumulate more maladaptive substitutions and are more prone to splicing errors. Thus, to a large extent, patterns of gene expression variants simply reflect the balance between selection, mutation, and drift.

	abstract = {Background: The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that the efficacy of natural selection increases with the effective population size. This prediction has been verified by independent observations in diverse taxa, which show that life-history traits are strongly correlated with measures of the efficacy of selection, such as the dN/dS ratio. Surprisingly, avian taxa are an exception to this theory because correlations between life-history traits and dN/dS are apparently absent. Here we explore the role of GC-biased gene conversion on estimates of substitution rates as a potential driver of these unexpected observations.
Results: We analyze the relationship between dN/dS estimated from alignments of 47 avian genomes and several proxies for effective population size. To distinguish the impact of GC-biased gene conversion from selection, we use an approach that accounts for non-stationary base composition and estimate dN/dS separately for changes affected or unaffected by GC-biased gene conversion. This analysis shows that the impact of GC-biased gene conversion on substitution rates can explain the lack of correlations between life-history traits and dN/dS. Strong correlations between life-history traits and dN/dS are recovered after accounting for GC-biased gene conversion. The correlations are robust to variation in base composition and genomic location.
Conclusions: Our study shows that gene sequence evolution across a wide range of avian lineages meets the prediction of the nearly neutral theory, the efficacy of selection increases with effective population size. Moreover, our study illustrates that accounting for GC-biased gene conversion is important to correctly estimate the strength of selection.},

This rule states that the amount of energy that each species uses per unit of area is independent of its body size. Here, we perform a meta-analytical procedure to combine and compare the slopes of population density and body size relationships across independent studies of mammals and birds. We then compared a dis-tribution of 50,000 bootstrap combined slopes with the expected slope (b = –0.75) under the EER. The combined slopes obtained for mammals and birds separately were –0.755 and –0.321, respec-tively. The homogeneity hypothesis (i. e. within studies the slopes differ by no more than would be expected due sampling variation) was rejected in both cases. So, EER cannot be supported since the use of an exponent of –0.75 is, in fact, an oversimplification. Significant heterogeneity of slopes within each group (mammals and birds) is an indicator of inferential problems related with variation in body size, spatial scale, the regression model adopted and phylogenetic relationships among species. So, we consider that questions regarding the estimation and validity of slopes is the next challenge of density-body size relationship studies.},

In Drosophila, recent ﬁndings of widespread selective constraint, as well as adaptive evolution, in both coding and noncoding regions highlight the difﬁculties in choosing such a reference sequence. Here, we investigate the utility of short intron sequences as a reference for the detection of selection. For a set of 119 Drosophila melanogaster genes containing 195 short introns ( 120 bp), we analyzed polymorphism and divergence at 1) 4-fold synonymous sites, 2) all sites of introns 120 bp, 3) all sites of introns 65 bp, 4) bases 8–30 of introns 120 bp, and 5) bases 8–30 of introns 65 bp. The last class of sites shows the highest levels of both interspeciﬁc divergence and intraspeciﬁc polymorphism, suggesting that these sites are under the least selective constraint. Bases 8–30 of introns 65 bp also have the lowest ratio of divergence to polymorphism, which may indicate that a small proportion of substitutions in the other classes of sites are the result of adaptive evolution. Although there is little signal of selection on the primary sequence of short introns, patterns of insertion–deletion polymorphism and divergence suggest that both positive and negative selection act to maintain an optimal intron length.},

	abstract = {Intron sizes show an asymmetrical distribution in a number of organisms, with a large number of "short" introns clustered around a minimal intron length and a much broader distribution of longer introns. In Drosophila melanogaster, the short intron class is centered around 61 bp. The narrow length distribution suggests that natural selection may play a role in maintaining intron size. A comparison of 15 orthologous introns among species of the D. melanogaster subgroup indicates that, in general, short introns are not under greater DNA sequence or length constraints than long introns. There is a bias toward deletions in all introns (deletion/insertion ratio is 1.66), and the vast majority of indels are of short length ({\textless}10 bp). Indels occurring on the internal branches of the phylogenetic tree are significantly longer than those occurring on the terminal branches. These results are consistent with a compensatory model of intron length evolution in which slightly deleterious short deletions are frequently fixed within species by genetic drift, and relatively rare larger insertions that restore intron length are fixed by positive selection. A comparison of paralogous introns shared among duplicated genes suggests that length constraints differ between introns within the same gene. The janusA, janusB, and ocnus genes share two short introns derived from a common ancestor. The first of these introns shows significantly fewer indels than the second intron, although the two introns show a comparable number of substitutions. This indicates that intron-specific selective constraints have been maintained following gene duplication, which preceded the divergence of the D. melanogaster species subgroup.},

We hypothesized that the age of gene origin is associated with expression constraints, given that it affects the level of gene integration into the functional cellular environment. By studying the genetic variation affecting gene expression levels (cis expression quantitative trait loci [cis-eQTLs]) and protein levels (cis protein QTLs [cis-pQTLs]), we determined that young, primate-specific genes are enriched in cis-eQTLs and cis-pQTLs. Compared to cis-eQTLs of old genes originating before the zebrafish divergence, cis-eQTLs of young genes have a higher effect size, are located closer to the transcription start site, are more significant, and tend to influence genes in multiple tissues and populations. These results suggest that the expression constraint of each gene increases throughout its lifespan. We also detected a positive correlation between expression constraints (approximated by cis-eQTL properties) and coding constraints (approximated by Ka/Ks) and observed that this correlation might be driven by gene age. To uncover factors associated with the increase in gene-age-related expression constraints, we demonstrated that gene connectivity, gene involvement in complex regulatory networks, gene haploinsufficiency, and the strength of posttranscriptional regulation increase with gene age. We also observed an increase in heritability of gene expression levels with age, implying a reduction of the environmental component. In summary, we show that gene age shapes key gene properties during evolution and is therefore an important component of genome function.},

	abstract = {An unconstrained reference sequence facilitates the detection of selection. In Drosophila, sequence variation in short introns seems to be least influenced by selection and dominated by mutation and drift. Here, we test this with genome-wide sequences using an African population (Malawi) of D. melanogaster and data from the related outgroup species D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. erecta and D. yakuba. The distribution of mutations deviates from equilibrium, and the content of A and T (AT) nucleotides shows an excess of variance among introns. We explain this by a complex mutational pattern: a shift in mutational bias towards AT, leading to a slight nonequilibrium in base composition and context-dependent mutation rates, with G or C (GC) sites mutating most frequently in AT-rich introns. By comparing the corresponding allele frequency spectra of AT-rich vs. GC-rich introns, we can rule out the influence of directional selection or biased gene conversion on the mutational pattern. Compared with neutral equilibrium expectations, polymorphism spectra show an excess of low frequency and a paucity of intermediate frequency variants, irrespective of the direction of mutation. Combining the information from different outgroups with the polymorphism data and using a generalized linear model, we find evidence for shared ancestral polymorphism between D. melanogaster and D. simulans, D. sechellia, arguing against a bottleneck in D. melanogaster. Generally, we find that short introns can be used as a neutral reference on a genome-wide level, if the spatially and temporally varying mutational pattern is accounted for.},

To correct for phylogenetic inertia, the method of independent contrasts assumes that continuous characters evolve along the phylogeny according to a multivariate Brownian process. Brownian diffusion processes have also been used to describe time variations of the parameters of the substitution process, such as the rate of substitution or the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions. Here, we develop a probabilistic framework for testing the coupling between continuous characters and parameters of the molecular substitution process. Rates of substitution and continuous characters are jointly modeled as a multivariate Brownian diffusion process of unknown covariance matrix. The covariance matrix, the divergence times and the phylogenetic variations of substitution rates and continuous characters are all jointly estimated in a Bayesian Monte Carlo framework, imposing on the covariance matrix a prior conjugate to the Brownian process so as to achieve a greater computational efﬁciency. The coupling between rates and phenotypes is assessed by measuring the posterior probability of positive or negative covariances, whereas divergence dates and phenotypic variations are marginally reconstructed in the context of the joint analysis. As an illustration, we apply the model to a set of 410 mammalian cytochrome b sequences. We observe a negative correlation between the rate of substitution and mass and longevity, which was previously observed. We also ﬁnd a positive correlation between ω = dN /dS and mass and longevity, which we interpret as an indirect effect of variations of effective population size, thus in partial agreement with the nearly neutral theory. The method can easily be extended to any parameter of the substitution process and to any continuous phenotypic or environmental character.},

	abstract = {Background
Diapause is a developmental alternative to direct ontogeny in many invertebrates. Its primary adaptive meaning is to secure survival over unfavourable seasons in a state of developmental arrest usually accompanied by metabolic suppression and enhanced tolerance to environmental stressors. During photoperiodically triggered diapause of insects, the ontogeny is centrally turned off under hormonal control, the molecular details of this transition being poorly understood. Using RNAseq technology, we characterized transcription profiles associated with photoperiodic diapause induction in the larvae of the drosophilid fly Chymomyza costata with the goal of identifying candidate genes and processes linked to upstream regulatory events that eventually lead to a complex phenotypic change.

Results
Short day photoperiod triggering diapause was associated to inhibition of 20-hydroxy ecdysone (20-HE) signalling during the photoperiod-sensitive stage of C. costata larval development. The mRNA levels of several key genes involved in 20-HE biosynthesis, perception, and signalling were significantly downregulated under short days. Hormonal change was translated into downregulation of a series of other transcripts with broad influence on gene expression, protein translation, alternative histone marking by methylation and alternative splicing. These changes probably resulted in blockade of direct development and deep restructuring of metabolic pathways indicated by differential expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, metabolism, detoxification, redox balance, protection against oxidative stress, cuticle formation and synthesis of larval storage proteins. This highly complex alteration of gene transcription was expressed already during first extended night, within the first four hours after the change of the photoperiodic signal from long days to short days. We validated our RNAseq differential gene expression results in an independent qRT-PCR experiment involving wild-type (photoperiodic) and NPD-mutant (non-photoperiodic) strains of C. costata.

Conclusions
Our study revealed several strong candidate genes for follow-up functional studies. Candidate genes code for upstream regulators of a complex change of gene expression, which leads to phenotypic switch from direct ontogeny to larval diapause.

The main causes of large genome size are proliferation of noncoding elements and/or duplication events. The relative role and interplay between these proximate causes and the evolutionary patterns shaped by phylogeny, life history traits or environment are largely unknown for the arthropods. Genome size shows a tremendous variability in this group, and it has a major impact on a range of fitness‐related parameters such as growth, metabolism, life history traits, and for many species also body size. In this study, we compared genome size in two major arthropod groups, insects and crustaceans, and related this to phylogenetic patterns and parameters affecting ambient temperature (latitude, depth, or altitude), insect developmental mode, as well as crustacean body size and habitat, for species where data were available. For the insects, the genome size is clearly phylogeny‐dependent, reflecting primarily their life history and mode of development, while for crustaceans there was a weaker association between genome size and phylogeny, suggesting life cycle strategies and habitat as more important determinants. Maximum observed latitude and depth, and their combined effect, showed positive, and possibly phylogenetic independent, correlations with genome size for crustaceans. This study illustrate the striking difference in genome sizes both between and within these two major groups of arthropods, and that while living in the cold with low developmental rates may promote large genomes in marine crustaceans, there is a multitude of proximate and ultimate drivers of genome size.},

Long-term exposure to low temperatures, commonly referred to as chilling, can lead to physiological effects collectively known as chill injury. Periodically increasing temperatures during long-term chilling has been shown to increase survival in many insects. However, the transcripts responsible for this increase in survival have never been characterized. Here, we present the first transcriptome-level analysis of increased longevity under fluctuating temperatures during chilling. Overwintering post-diapause quiescent alfalfa leafcutting bees (Megachile rotundata) were exposed to a constant temperature of 6°C, or 6°C with a daily fluctuation to 20°C. RNA was collected at two different time points, before and after mortality rates began to diverge between temperature treatments. Expression analysis identified differentially regulated transcripts between pairwise comparisons of both treatments and time points. Transcripts functioning in ion homeostasis, metabolic pathways and oxidative stress response were up-regulated in individuals exposed to periodic temperature fluctuations during chilling. The differential expression of these transcripts provides support for the hypotheses that fluctuating temperatures protect against chill injury by reducing oxidative stress and returning ion concentrations and metabolic function to more favorable levels. Additionally, exposure to fluctuating temperatures leads to increased expression of transcripts functioning in the immune response and neurogenesis, providing evidence for additional mechanisms associated with increased survival during chilling in M. rotundata.},

We discovered that 11.2\% and 10.4\% of the multiexon genes had AS transcripts during Bgt and Pst infections, respectively. In response to fungal infection, wheat modulated AS not only in disease resistance proteins, but also in splicing related factors. Apart from the stress induced or activated splicing variants by pathogen, the diﬀerential expression proﬁles were fold increased through changing the ratio of full spliced transcripts versus intron retention (IR) transcripts. Comparing AS transcripts produced by the same gene in Bgt with Pst stress, the spliced terminal exons and the stranded introns are independent and diﬀerent. This demonstrated that diﬀerential induction of speciﬁc splice variants were activated against two fungal pathogens. The speciﬁc induced AS genes in the Pst-resistant plants were enriched in improving the membrane permeability and protein modiﬁcation ability, whereas gene expression involved in protein translation and transport were strengthened in Pst-susceptible plants.},

Neither a conserved branch point nor a polypyrimidine tract, found in yeast and vertebrate introns respectively, are required. Instead, AU-rich sequences, a characteristic feature of dicot plant introns, are essential. Here we show that splicing in protoplasts of maize, a monocot, differs significantly from splicing in a dicot, Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. As in the case of dicots, a conserved branch point and a polypyrimidine tract are not required for intron processing in maize. However, unlike in dicots, AU-rich sequences are not essential, although their presence facilitates splicing if the splice site sequences are not optimal. The lack of an absolute requirement for AU-rich stretches in monocot introns in reflected in the occurrence of GC-rich introns in monocots but not in dicots. We also show that maize protoplasts are able to process a mammalian intron and short introns containing stem--loops, neither of which are spliced in N.plumbaginifolia protoplasts. The ability of maize, but not of N.plumbaginifolia to process stem--loop-containing or GC-rich introns suggests that one of the functions of AU-rich sequences during splicing of dicot plant pre-mRNAs may be to minimize secondary structure within the intron.},

Although several genomic features have been associated with organism complexity, in the case of alternative splicing, which has long been proposed to explain the variation in complexity, no such link has been established. Here, we analyzed over 39 million expressed sequence tags available for 47 eukaryotic species with fully sequenced genomes to obtain a comparable index of alternative splicing estimates, which corrects for the distorting effect of a variable number of transcripts per species—an important obstacle for comparative studies of alternative splicing. We find that alternative splicing has steadily increased over the last 1,400 My of eukaryotic evolution and is strongly associated with organism complexity, assayed as the number of cell types. Importantly, this association is not explained as a by-product of covariance between alternative splicing with other variables previously linked to complexity including gene content, protein length, proteome disorder, and protein interactivity. In addition, we found no evidence to suggest that the relationship of alternative splicing to cell type number is explained by drift due to reduced Ne in more complex species. Taken together, our results firmly establish alternative splicing as a significant predictor of organism complexity and are, in principle, consistent with an important role of transcript diversification through alternative splicing as a means of determining a genome’s functional information capacity.},

Using in vitro splicing assays, we demonstrate that splice-site recognition across introns ceases when intron size is between 200 and 250 nucleotides. Beyond this threshold, splice sites are recognized across the exon. Splice-site recognition across the intron is significantly more efficient than splice-site recognition across the exon, resulting in enhanced inclusion of exons with weak splice sites. Thus, intron size can profoundly influence the likelihood that an exon is constitutively or alternatively spliced. An EST-based alternative-splicing database was used to determine whether the exon/intron architecture influences the probability of alternative splicing in the Drosophila and human genomes. Drosophila exons flanked by long introns display an up to 90-fold-higher probability of being alternatively spliced compared with exons flanked by two short introns, demonstrating that the exon/intron architecture in Drosophila is a major determinant in governing the frequency of alternative splicing. Exon skipping is also more likely to occur when exons are flanked by long introns in the human genome. Interestingly, experimental and computational analyses show that the length of the upstream intron is more influential in inducing alternative splicing than is the length of the downstream intron. We conclude that the size and location of the flanking introns control the mechanism of splice-site recognition and influence the frequency and the type of alternative splicing that a pre-mRNA transcript undergoes.},

For some genes, the contribution of introns to the time required for transcription can also be functionally significant. We have previously shown that intron length in genes associated with developmental patterning is often highly conserved. In general, sets of genes that require precise coordination in the timing of their expression may be sensitive to changes in transcript length. A prediction of this hypothesis is that evolutionary changes in intron length, when they occur, may be correlated between sets of coordinately expressed genes. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed intron length coevolution in alignments from nine eutherian mammals. Overall, genes that belong to the same protein complex or that are coexpressed were significantly more likely to show evidence of intron length coevolution than matched, randomly sampled genes. Individually, protein complexes involved in the cell cycle showed the strongest evidence of coevolution of intron lengths and clusters of coexpressed genes enriched for cell cycle genes also showed significant evidence of intron length coevolution. Our results reveal a novel aspect of gene coevolution and provide a means to identify genes, protein complexes and biological processes that may be particularly sensitive to changes in transcriptional dynamics.},

Third-generation sequencing has filled this gap and allows end-to-end sequencing of entire RNA/cDNA molecules. This approach to transcriptomics has been a “niche” technology for a couple of years but now is becoming mainstream with many different applications.

We then focus on long-noncoding RNA isoforms and the distinct combination patterns of exons in noncoding and coding genes. We consider the implications of the recent technologies of direct RNA sequencing and single-cell isoform RNA sequencing. Finally, we discuss the parameters that define the success of long-read RNA sequencing experiments and strategies commonly used to make the most of such data.},

	abstract = {Tissue-speciﬁc alternative splicing profoundly effects animal physiology, development and disease, and this is nowhere more evident than in the nervous system. Alternative splicing is a versatile form of genetic control whereby a common pre-mRNA is processed into multiple mRNA isoforms differing in their precise combination of exon sequences. In the nervous system, thousands of alternatively spliced mRNAs are translated into their protein counterparts where speciﬁc isoforms play roles in learning and memory, neuronal cell recognition, neurotransmission, ion channel function, and receptor speciﬁcity. The essential nature of this process is underscored by the ﬁnding that its misregulation is a common characteristic of human disease. This review highlights the current views of the biological phenomenon of alternative splicing, and describes evidence for its intricate underlying biochemical mechanisms. The roles of RNA binding proteins and their tissue-speciﬁc properties are discussed. Why does alternative splicing occur in cosmic proportions in the nervous system? How does it affect integrated cellular functions? How are region-speciﬁc, cell-speciﬁc and developmental differences in splicing directed? How are the control mechanisms that operate in the nervous system distinct from those of other tissues? Although there are many unanswered questions, substantial progress has been made in showing that alternative splicing is of major importance in generating proteomic diversity, and in modulating protein activities in a temporal and spatial manner. The relevance of alternative splicing to diseases of the nervous system is also discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: TNF-α, a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine is one of the major contributors for metabolic syndromes including insulin resistance, obesity, type II diabetes etc. The role of alternative splicing, a post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression on the onset of these syndromes is poorly understood. However, the role of alternative splicing, which more than 95\% of all exons in eukaryotic cells undergo in several other diseases including cancer and muscle dystrophy, has been elucidated. In this study we aim to investigate the role of alternative splicing in pathways leading to metabolic syndromes mediated by TNF-α.
Methods: A genome wide transcriptome analysis was carried out using Illumina platform. Results were validated using RT-PCR analysis. Various bioinformatics tools and databases (for example IPA, KEGG, STRING etc) were used for the pathway and interactome analysis. Current ﬁndings: Transcriptome wide analysis revealed that TNF-α treatment in vitro causes a signiﬁcant change in expression of 228 genes at the level of alternative splicing. Regulation of some of these genes was validated in diﬀerent cell lines. Pathway analysis showed at least 15\% of the alternatively spliced genes fall under the contributory pathways leading to diﬀerent metabolic syndromes, among which the maximally interconnected genes were transcription regulators.
Conclusion: These ﬁndings suggest that TNF-α.-mediated alternative splicing plays a crucial role in regulating various genes involved in pathways connected to metabolic syndromes.},

Almost 98\% of mammalian genome is transcribed into nonprotein coding RNA termed as noncoding RNA (ncRNA) which plays regulatory role in molecular and cellular functions as controlling gene expression. These ncRNAs are classified as long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), short noncoding RNA (sncRNA), and translational/structural RNA which possess diverse functions. These ncRNAs regulate expression of normal gene and modulate disease development and progression. The characterization of ncRNA genes and their mechanisms can aid in disease diagnosis, examining its development and direct specific therapies in different disease treatments. Due to their unique modes of action, they are designated as novel class of targets leading to drug discovery. The modulation in these ncRNAs can enhance therapeutic treatments against different diseases by targeting mRNA for its cleavage via antisense olionucleotides (ASOs)/DNA duplex, RNA alternative splicing/editing, chromatin modification, transcriptional/translational interference, RNA masking, small interfering RNA/microRNA-based gene silencing and by inducing immunity via RNA-based vaccination.

This pathway has evolved from an ancestral mechanism where dsx was independent of tra and expressed and required only in males. To reconstruct this transition, we examined three basal, hemimetabolous insect orders: Hemiptera, Phthiraptera, and Blattodea. We show that tra and dsx have distinct functions in these insects, reflecting different stages in the changeover from a transcription-based to a splicing-based mode of sexual differentiation. We propose that the canonical insect tra-dsx pathway evolved via merger between expanding dsx function (from males to both sexes) and narrowing tra function (from a general splicing factor to dedicated regulator of dsx).},

Cytoplasmic RBM4 interacts with Ago2 to regulate inflammatory responses by affecting mRNA decay and cap-dependent translation. However, it is unclear whether RBM4 functions in inflammation regulation by its splicing factor role. Here, the cell biology, gene expression profile and alternative splicing pattern of HeLa cells with RBM4 overexpression (RBM-OE) were compared with the control. The results showed that RBM4-OE inhibited proliferation. RBM4-OE extensively affects the transcriptional level of genes involved in cell surface receptor signalling pathway, inflammatory responses and the response to lipopolysaccharide. RBM4 broadly regulated the alternative splicing of hundreds of genes with functions of protein binding, helicase activity, DNA binding and transcription co-activator. RBM4-regulated splicing of these genes plays an important role in apoptotic process and gene transcription regulation. As an example, exon inclusion of TNIP1 mediated by RBM4 affects the expression of its targets in inflammatory pathways. These results indicated that RBM4 can mediate the inflammatory response via splicing regulation, which adds to the understanding of the critical role of RBM4 in cancer complicated by inflammation. In conclusion, this study indicated a mechanism in which the dysregulation of alternative splicing can influence cellular biology and lead to various immune-related diseases.},

	abstract = {Background
Alternative splicing (AS) regulates diverse cellular and developmental functions through alternative protein structures of different isoforms. Alternative exons dominate AS in vertebrates; however, very little is known about the extent and function of AS in lower eukaryotes. To understand the role of introns in gene evolution, we examined AS from a green algal and five fungal genomes using a novel EST-based gene-modeling algorithm (COMBEST).

Methods
AS from each genome was classified with COMBEST that maps EST sequences to genomes to build gene models. Various aspects of AS were analyzed through statistical methods. The interplay of intron 3n length, phase, coding property, and intron retention (RI) were examined with Chi-square testing.

Results
With 3 to 834 times EST coverage, we identified up to 73\% of AS in intron-containing genes and found preponderance of RI among 11 types of AS. The number of exons, expression level, and maximum intron length correlated with number of AS per gene (NAG), and intron-rich genes suppressed AS. Genes with AS were more ancient, and AS was conserved among fungal genomes. Among stopless introns, non-retained introns (NRI) avoided, but major RI preferred 3n length. In contrast, stop-containing introns showed uniform distribution among 3n, 3n+1, and 3n+2 lengths. We found a clue to the intron phase enigma: it was the coding function of introns involved in AS that dictates the intron phase bias.

Conclusions
Majority of AS is non-functional, and the extent of AS is suppressed for intron-rich genes. RI through 3n length, stop codon, and phase bias bridges the transition from functionless to functional alternative isoforms.},

	abstract = {Background
Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism for increasing transcriptome and proteome diversity in eukaryotes. Particularly in multicellular eukaryotes, this mechanism is involved in the regulation of developmental and physiological processes like growth, differentiation and signal transduction.

Results
Here we report the genome-wide analysis of alternative splicing in the multicellular green alga Volvox carteri. The bioinformatic analysis of 132,038 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) identified 580 alternative splicing events in a total of 426 genes. The predominant type of alternative splicing in Volvox is intron retention (46.5\%) followed by alternative 5′ (17.9\%) and 3′ (21.9\%) splice sites and exon skipping (9.5\%). Our analysis shows that in Volvox at least {\textasciitilde}2.9\% of the intron-containing genes are subject to alternative splicing. Considering the total number of sequenced ESTs, the Volvox genome seems to provide more favorable conditions (e.g., regarding length and GC content of introns) for the occurrence of alternative splicing than the genome of its close unicellular relative Chlamydomonas. Moreover, many randomly chosen alternatively spliced genes of Volvox do not show alternative splicing in Chlamydomonas. Since the Volvox genome contains about the same number of protein-coding genes as the Chlamydomonas genome ({\textasciitilde}14,500 protein-coding genes), we assumed that alternative splicing may play a key role in generation of genomic diversity, which is required to evolve from a simple one-cell ancestor to a multicellular organism with differentiated cell types (Mol Biol Evol 31:1402-1413, 2014). To confirm the alternative splicing events identified by bioinformatic analysis, several genes with different types of alternatively splicing have been selected followed by experimental verification of the predicted splice variants by RT-PCR.

Conclusions
The results show that our approach for prediction of alternative splicing events in Volvox was accurate and reliable. Moreover, quantitative real-time RT-PCR appears to be useful in Volvox for analyses of relationships between the appearance of specific alternative splicing variants and different kinds of physiological, metabolic and developmental processes as well as responses to environmental changes.

	abstract = {Exonic splice enhancers (ESEs) are short nucleotide motifs, enriched near exon ends, that enhance the recognition of the splice site and thus promote splicing. Are intronless genes under selection to avoid these motifs so as not to attract the splicing machinery to an mRNA that should not be spliced, thereby preventing the production of an aberrant transcript? Consistent with this possibility, we find that ESEs in putative recent retrocopies are at a higher density and evolving faster than those in other intronless genes, suggesting that they are being lost. Moreover, intronless genes are less dense in putative ESEs than intron-containing ones. However, this latter difference is likely due to the skewed base composition of intronless sequences, a skew that is in line with the general GC richness of few exon genes. Indeed, after controlling for such biases, we find that both intronless and intron-containing genes are denser in ESEs than expected by chance. Importantly, nucleotide-controlled analysis of evolutionary rates at synonymous sites in ESEs indicates that the ESEs in intronless genes are under purifying selection in both human and mouse. We conclude that on the loss of introns, some but not all, ESE motifs are lost, the remainder having functions beyond a role in splice promotion. These results have implications for the design of intronless transgenes and for understanding the causes of selection on synonymous sites.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Larger numbers of germline cell divisions can increase the number of mutations inherited by offspring. Therefore, in systems where the number of offspring is dependent on the number of germline cell divisions, a higher overall rate of molecular evolution may be expected. Here I examine whether colony size in social insects, which varies from tens to millions, influences molecular evolutionary rates by analyzing several recently collected datasets. First, I find that colony size is negatively correlated with GC-content across 115 ant genera, indicative of a positive relationship between substitution rate and colony size. Second, genome-wide rates of molecular evolution are positively correlated with colony size in three clades of social insects including eight species in the ant genus Pseudomyrmex, seven fungus-growing ants, and 11 bee species. The additional germline cell divisions necessary to maintain large colony sizes might lead to mutation accumulation in the germlines of queens of these species, a process similar to that which occurs in aging human males. I also find intensified constraint on DNA repair genes in species with large colonies, suggesting that the additional mutations that occur in these taxa increase selective pressure for improved replication fidelity. Colony size, a fundamental facet of eusociality, plays a previously unappreciated role in genome evolution.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	doi = {10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026334},
	abstract = {The use of some multiple-sequence alignments in phylogenetic analysis, particularly those that are not very well conserved, requires the elimination of poorly aligned positions and divergent regions, since they may not be homologous or may have been saturated by multiple substitutions. A computerized method that eliminates such positions and at the same time tries to minimize the loss of informative sites is presented here. The method is based on the selection of blocks of positions that fulfill a simple set of requirements with respect to the number of contiguous conserved positions, lack of gaps, and high conservation of flanking positions, making the final alignment more suitable for phylogenetic analysis. To illustrate the efficiency of this method, alignments of 10 mitochondrial proteins from several completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes belonging to diverse eukaryotes were used as examples. The percentages of removed positions were higher in the most divergent alignments. After removing divergent segments, the amino acid composition of the different sequences was more uniform, and pairwise distances became much smaller. Phylogenetic trees show that topologies can be different after removing conserved blocks, particularly when there are several poorly resolved nodes. Strong support was found for the grouping of animals and fungi but not for the position of more basal eukaryotes. The use of a computerized method such as the one presented here reduces to a certain extent the necessity of manually editing multiple alignments, makes the automation of phylogenetic analysis of large data sets feasible, and facilitates the reproduction of the final alignment by other researchers.},

MUSCLE achieves the highest, or joint highest, rank in accuracy on each of these sets. Without refinement, MUSCLE achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from T-Coffee and MAFFT, and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of sequences, aligning 5000 sequences of average length 350 in 7 min on a current desktop computer.
